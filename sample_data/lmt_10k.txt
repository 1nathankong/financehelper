Intellectual Property
We routinely apply for and own a substantial number of U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks related to the products and services we provide. We also develop and own other intellectual property, including copyrights, trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how, that contributes significantly to our business. In addition, we license intellectual property to and from third parties. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) and Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) provide the U.S. Government certain rights in intellectual property, including patents, developed by us and our subcontractors and suppliers in performance of government contracts or with government funding. The U.S. Government may use or authorize others, including competitors, to use such intellectual property. See the discussion of matters related to our intellectual property in Item 1A - Risk Factors. Non-U.S. governments also may have certain rights in patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of our contracts for them. Although our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of our business, we do not believe that any existing patent, license or other intellectual property right is of such importance that its loss or termination would have a material adverse effect on our business taken as a whole.
Research and Development
We conduct research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded or independent R&D (IR&D)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers (referred to as customer-funded R&D) to enhance existing products and services and to develop future technologies. R&D costs include basic research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and related test activities. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” (under the caption “Research and development and similar costs”) included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Raw Materials, Suppliers and Seasonality
Some of our products require relatively scarce raw materials, such as rare earth minerals. Other important materials and components, on which certain of our products rely, include aluminum, titanium, specialty steel, carbon fiber and advanced microelectronics, such as semiconductors. We rely on other companies to provide materials, components and products and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. Although long-term agreements have historically helped enable a continued supply of these materials, supply chain challenges, supplier disputes, regulatory restrictions, and inflationary pressures have caused certain parts’ shortages, extended lead times and pricing escalations affecting certain sources of supply. We are working with U.S. Government, customers and suppliers on phase-in of regulatory requirements for transitioning the supply chains for rare earth minerals and magnets to secure and compliant sources. The current availability of sources of supply meeting regulatory requirements and the ability to ensure compliance down to the mining level within the timeframes required by the regulations are challenges we continue to work with our multi-tier supplier base. At the same time, we are focused on minimizing the impact of these supply chain challenges on our programs. However, many of the challenges are industry wide or caused by geopolitical events and general economic conditions that are outside of our control. These supplier disruptions have resulted in delays and increased costs and have adversely affected our program performance and operating results. These dynamics are expected to continue in 2025. For more information on the risks related to our suppliers and raw materials, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.
No material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal. Various factors, however, can affect the distribution of our sales between accounting periods, including the timing of government awards, the availability of government funding, product deliveries and customer acceptance.
Human Capital
Due to the specialized nature of our business, our performance depends on identifying, attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a highly skilled workforce with the requisite skills and, in many cases, security clearances, in multiple areas, including engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and management. Our human capital management strategy, which we refer to as our people strategy, tightly aligns to our business needs and technology strategy and focused in 2024 on continuing to accelerate the transformation of our technology for workforce management through investments in upgraded systems and processes, increasing our ability to meet the quickly changing needs of our business, and maintaining a working environment and culture that is supportive of all employees and reflects our core value of “Respect Others.” We structure our people strategy and its implementation to comply with the laws and regulations to which we are subject as a federal government contractor.
As of December 31, 2024, we had a highly skilled workforce made up of approximately 121,000 employees, including approximately 70,000 engineers, scientists and information technology professionals. As of December 31, 2024, approximately 93% of our workforce was located in the U.S. and approximately 19% of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. A number of our existing collective bargaining agreements expire in any given year. Historically, we have been successful in renegotiating expiring agreements without any material disruption of operating activities, and management considers employee and union relations to be good. This has continued to be the case in 2024.
We strive to hire, develop and retain the top talent in the industry. During 2024, we hired nearly 9,200 employees and we hired 3,900 college hires and interns during the 2023-24 academic year. An integral part of our people strategy is early career hiring through college and intern pipelines, particularly in technical fields and critical skills areas. We seek to access the broadest possible pool of talent to enable us to meet our hiring needs, and we work to expand Lockheed Martin’s brand awareness and positioning as a best place to work.
Employee satisfaction is essential to attracting and retaining top talent, and we regularly conduct employee engagement surveys to gauge employee satisfaction and to understand the effectiveness of our people strategy and assess employees’ intent to stay. We attract and reward our employees by providing market competitive compensation and benefits, including incentives and recognition plans that extend to non-represented employees of all levels in our organization and encourage excellence through our pay-for-performance philosophy. We have a hybrid workforce model that enables flexible working arrangements for employees and teams who can meet our customer commitments remotely, which has helped recruit and retain talent. In addition, we invest in the development of our employees through training, apprenticeship programs, security clearance sponsorship, leadership development plans and offering tuition assistance programs for continuing education or industry certifications. We believe this employee development makes us more competitive and assists with leadership succession planning throughout the company. In addition to efforts focused on recruitment and retention, we also monitor employee attrition across our employee population and take action based on the insights we gain from that monitoring process.
Employee Safety and Health
Through our safety and health program we seek to optimize our operations with targeted safety, health and wellness opportunities designed to provide safe work conditions and a healthy work environment, promote workforce resiliency and enhance business value. As part of this program, we track employee health and safety measures, including quarterly and yearly targets related to the number of injury and illness incidents that occur at work, those incidents that result in days lost, and the number of days lost due to workplace injuries and illness.
For information on the risks related to our human capital resources, see Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Competition
We compete with many different companies both within and outside of the defense and aerospace industry. The Boeing Company, General Dynamics, L3Harris Technologies, Northrop Grumman, and RTX Corporation are some of our primary competitors. Key characteristics of our industry include long operating cycles and intense competition, which is evident through the number of competitors bidding on program opportunities and the existence of bid protests (competitor protests of U.S. Government procurement awards).
We often collaborate with our competitors through teaming arrangements in efforts to provide our customers with the best mix of capabilities to address specific requirements, such as our recently announced strategic teaming agreement with General Dynamics to produce solid rocket motors, enhancing security and resilience in a critical domestic supply chain. Additionally, a company competing to be a prime contractor may, upon ultimate award of the contract to another competitor, serve as a subcontractor to the ultimate prime contracting company. It is not unusual to compete for a contract award with a peer company and, simultaneously, perform as a supplier to or a customer of that same competitor on other contracts.
Our broad portfolio of products and services competes domestically and internationally against products and services of the companies listed above, numerous smaller competitors and startups, and increasingly, non-traditional and non-U.S. defense contractors. In some areas of our business, customer requirements are changing to encourage or facilitate expanded competition. Principal factors of competition include: the technical excellence, reliability, safety and cost competitiveness of our products and services to the customer; technical and management capability; the ability to innovate and develop new products and technologies that improve mission performance and adapt to dynamic threats; successful program execution and on-time delivery of complex, integrated systems; the reputation and customer confidence derived from past performance; our demonstrated ability to execute and perform against contract requirements and successfully manage customer relationships; and our global footprint and accessibility to customers.
The competition for international sales for most of our products and services is subject to U.S. Government stipulations (e.g., export restrictions, market access, technology transfer, industrial cooperation and contracting practices). We compete against U.S. and non-U.S. companies (or teams) for contract awards by international governments. International competitions are also subject to different laws or contracting practices of international governments, which affects how we structure our bid for the procurement. In many international procurements, the purchasing government’s relationship with the U.S. and its industrial cooperation programs designed to enhance local industry are important factors in determining the outcome of a competition. It is common for international customers to require contractors to comply with their industrial cooperation regulations, sometimes referred to as offset requirements, and we have entered into foreign offset agreements as part of securing some international business. For more information concerning our international business, see “International Business” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Technological advances in such areas as additive manufacturing, data analytics, digital engineering, artificial intelligence, advanced materials, autonomy and robotics, and new business models such as commercial access to space, are enabling new factors of competition for both traditional and non-traditional competitors. For more information on the risks related to new technologies, see Item 1A - Risk Factors.
Regulatory Matters
Our business is heavily regulated. We contract with numerous U.S. Government agencies and entities, principally all branches of the U.S. military and NASA. We also contract with similar government authorities in other countries, either under the foreign military sales (FMS) program, contracted through the U.S. Government, or as a direct sale with the foreign government authority, which regulates these sales in a manner similar to the U.S. Government.
Government Contracts
We must comply with, and are affected by, laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. Government and other governments’ contracts, including foreign governments. These laws and regulations, among other things:
•
require certification and disclosure of all cost or pricing data in connection with certain types of contract negotiations;
•
impose specific and unique cost accounting practices that may differ from U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP);
•
impose acquisition regulations, which may change or be replaced over time, that define which costs can be charged to the U.S. Government, how and when costs can be charged, and otherwise govern our right to reimbursement under certain U.S. Government and foreign contracts;
•
require specific security controls to protect U.S. Government controlled unclassified information and that our suppliers that have access to this type of information comply with cyber security regulations;
•
restrict the use and dissemination of information classified for national security purposes and the export of certain products, services and technical data;
•
prohibit the acquisition from or use by contractors of materials, products or services procured from certain countries or entities located outside the United States (e.g., the prohibition on the acquisition of sensitive materials from non-allied foreign nations and prohibition on the acquisition and use of certain telecommunications and video surveillance services or equipment); and
•
require the review and approval of contractor business systems, including accounting systems, estimating systems, earned value management systems for managing cost and schedule performance on certain complex programs, purchasing systems, material management and accounting systems for planning, controlling and accounting for the acquisition, use, issuing and disposition of material, and property management systems.
The U.S. Government and in limited cases certain other governments may terminate any of our government contracts and subcontracts either at their convenience or for default based on our performance. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we generally are protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs. If a contract is terminated for default, we generally are entitled to payment for our work that has been accepted by the U.S. Government or other governments; however, the U.S. Government and other governments could make claims to reduce our recovery or recoup its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties. For more information regarding the U.S. Government’s and other governments’ right to terminate our contracts and the risks of doing work internationally, see Item 1A – Risk Factors. For more information regarding government contracting laws and regulations, see Item 1A – Risk Factors as well as “Critical Accounting Policies – Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
Additionally, our programs for the U.S. Government often operate for periods of time under undefinitized contract actions (UCAs), which means that we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties. Although in most cases we historically have reached mutual agreement to definitize our UCAs, the U.S. Government has the ability to unilaterally definitize contracts and has done so in the past. Absent a successful appeal of such action, the unilateral definitization of the contract obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government’s power to unilaterally definitize a contract can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms and, if a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.
Classified Contracts
A portion of our business is classified by the U.S. Government and cannot be specifically described. The operating results of classified contracts are included in our consolidated financial statements. The business risks and capital requirements associated with classified contracts historically have not differed materially from those of our other U.S. Government contracts. However, under certain classified fixed-price development and production contracts, we are unable to insure risk of loss to government property because of the classified nature of the contracts and the inability to disclose classified information necessary for underwriting and claims to commercial insurers. Our internal controls addressing the financial reporting of classified contracts are consistent with our internal controls for our non-classified contracts.
Commercial Aircraft
Our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with U.S. and international regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety.
Environmental
Our operations are subject to and affected by various federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws and regulations regarding the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise regulating the protection of the environment. As a result of these environmental protection laws, we are involved in environmental remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party as a result of our prior activities and those of our predecessor companies. Although the extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated, the costs of environmental compliance have not had, and we do not expect that these costs will have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations, primarily because substantially all of our environmental costs are allowable in establishing the price of our products and services under our contracts with the U.S. Government. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or cleanup to the extent that they are probable and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. See also the discussion of environmental matters in Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Climate and Sustainability Reporting and Regulation
There is an increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change. Various jurisdictions around the world in which we operate, including the U.S., the European Union, the United Kingdom, Australia and certain U.S. States, have adopted or proposed laws related to climate and sustainability reporting. These and future laws, regulations or policies in response to concerns over GHG emissions such as carbon taxes, mandatory reporting and disclosure obligations, including environmental requirements for certain federal contractors and subcontractors, and changes in procurement policies, including the use of environmental goals in proposal evaluation, could significantly increase our operational and compliance burdens and costs. We monitor developments in climate change-related regulation for their potential effect on us and also have a comprehensive sustainability program that seeks to mitigate our impact on the environment, including targets to reduce our GHG emissions. For more information on the risk of climate-change related regulation, see Item 1A – Risk Factors.
Other Applicable Regulations
Our business and operations are subject to both U.S. and non-U.S. government laws, regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to product testing, import-export controls, technology transfer restrictions, foreign investment, tariffs, taxation, repatriation of earnings, sanctions, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018.

ITEM 1A.    Risk Factors
An investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties. While we seek to identify, manage and mitigate risks to our business, risk and uncertainty cannot be eliminated or necessarily predicted. The outcome of one or more of these risks could have a material effect on our operating results, financial position, or cash flows. You should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to trade in our common stock or debt securities.
Risks Related to our Reliance on Government Contracts, our Industry and the Economy
We depend heavily on contracts with the U.S. Government for a substantial portion of our business. Changes in the U.S. Government’s priorities, or delays or reductions in spending could have a material adverse effect on our business.
We derived 73% of our total consolidated net sales from the U.S. Government in 2024, including 65% from the Department of Defense (DoD). We expect to continue to derive most of our sales from work performed under U.S. Government contracts. A reduction in overall U.S. defense spending, on an absolute or inflation-adjusted basis, because of shifting priorities, budget compromises or otherwise could adversely affect our business. Budget uncertainty, the potential for U.S. Government shutdowns, the use of continuing resolutions, and the federal debt ceiling can adversely affect our industry and the funding for our programs. If appropriations are delayed or a government shutdown were to occur and continue for an extended period, we could be at risk of reduced orders, program cancellations and other disruptions and nonpayment. When the U.S. Government operates under a continuing resolution, new contract and program starts are restricted and funding for our programs may be unavailable, reduced or delayed.
Our contracts with the U.S. Government are conditioned upon the continuing availability of Congressional appropriations. Congress usually appropriates funds on a fiscal year (FY) basis even though contract performance may extend over many years. Consequently, contracts are often partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations over time. To the extent we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract or in advance of a contract award or contract definitization, we are at risk of not being reimbursed for those costs unless and until additional funds are obligated under the contract or the contract is successfully awarded, definitized and funded, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Failure to fund or the termination of significant programs or contracts by the U.S. Government could adversely affect our business and financial performance. DoD’s changes in funding priorities also could reduce opportunities in existing programs and in future programs or initiatives where we intend to compete and where we have made investments. While we would expect to compete and be well positioned as the incumbent on existing programs, we may not be successful and, even if we are successful, the replacement programs may be funded at lower levels or result in lower margins. In addition, our ability to grow in key areas such as hypersonics programs, classified programs and next-generation franchise programs will be affected by the
overall budget environment and whether development programs transition to production and the timing of such transition, all of which are dependent on U.S. Government authorization and funding.
The F-35 program comprises a material portion of our revenue and reductions or delays in funding for this program and risks related to performance, schedule, cost and requirements of the program could adversely affect our performance.
The F-35 program, which consists of multiple development, production and sustainment contracts, is our largest program and represented 26% of our total consolidated net sales in 2024. A decision by the U.S. Government, international partners, or FMS customer countries to cut spending on this program or reduce or delay planned orders would have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations. Given the size and complexity of the F-35 program, we anticipate that there will be continual reviews related to aircraft performance, program and delivery schedule, cost, and requirements as part of the DoD, Congressional, and international countries’ oversight and budgeting processes. Challenges and risks associated with this program include supplier performance, software development, definitizing and receiving funding for contracts on a timely basis, execution of future flight tests and findings resulting from testing and operating the aircraft, the level of cost associated with life cycle operations, sustainment and potential contractual obligations, inflation-related cost pressures, the ability to improve affordability, and potential competition from next-generation or other platforms. See also “Status of the F-35 Program” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the current program status and specific challenges and risks.
We also may not be successful in making hardware upgrades and other modernization capabilities in a timely manner, including as a result of dependencies on suppliers, which could increase costs and create schedule delays. Our ability to capture and retain future F-35 growth in development, production and sustainment is dependent on the success of our efforts to achieve F-35 sustainment performance, customer affordability, supply chain improvements, continued reliability improvements and other efficiencies, some of which are outside our control. See also the Risk Factor below captioned “We are heavily dependent on suppliers and if our subcontractors or other suppliers or teaming agreement or joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations, our performance and ability to win future business could be adversely affected” for further discussion.
We are subject to extensive procurement laws and regulations, including those that enable the U.S. Government to terminate contracts for convenience. Our business and reputation could be adversely affected if we or those we do business with fail to comply with these laws and regulations.
We must comply with extensive laws and regulations relating to the award, administration and performance of U.S. Government contracts. Government contract laws and regulations affect how we do business with our customers and impose certain risks and costs on our business. A violation of these laws and regulations by us, our employees, others working on our behalf, a supplier or a joint venture partner could harm our reputation and result in the imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of our contracts, suspension or debarment from bidding on or being awarded contracts, loss of our ability to export products or perform services and civil or criminal investigations or proceedings. From time to time, the U.S. Government has proposed contract terms, imposed internal policies, or taken positions that represent fundamental changes from historical practices or that we believe are inconsistent with the FAR or other laws and regulations and that could adversely affect our business. In addition, costs to comply with new government regulations can increase our costs, reduce our margins and adversely affect our competitiveness. Also, a portion of our contracts are classified by the U.S. Government, which imposes security requirements that limit our ability to discuss our performance on these contracts, including any specific risks, disputes and claims.
Contract Termination.
The U.S. Government may terminate any of our government contracts at its convenience or for default based on our performance, either of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Generally, prime contractors have similar termination rights under subcontracts related to government contracts. If a contract is terminated for convenience, we generally are protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contract and profit on those costs. However, to the extent insufficient funds have been appropriated by the U.S. Government to cover our costs upon a termination for convenience, the U.S. Government may assert that it is not required to appropriate additional funding. If a contract is terminated for default, the U.S. Government could make claims to reduce our recovery or recoup its procurement costs and could assess other special penalties, exposing us to liability and adversely affecting our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, the U.S. Government could terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor, notwithstanding the fact that our performance and the quality of the products or services we delivered were consistent with our contractual obligations as a subcontractor.
Undefinitized Contract Action (UCA).
When operating under a undefinitized contract action (UCA), which is when we begin performing our obligations before the terms, specifications or price are finally agreed to between the parties, the U.S. Government has the right to unilaterally definitize contracts, which it has exercised in the past and which, absent a successful appeal, obligates us to perform under terms and conditions imposed by the U.S. Government. This can affect our ability to negotiate mutually agreeable contract terms. If a contract is unilaterally imposed upon us, it may negatively affect our expected profit and cash flows on a program or impose burdensome terms.
Bid Protests.
U.S Government procurement laws permit legal challenges, referred to as bid protests, to the terms of a contract solicitation or the award of a contract. We may encounter bid protests from unsuccessful bidders on new program awards seeking to overturn the award. Unsuccessful bidders also may protest with the goal of being awarded a subcontract for a portion of the work in return for withdrawing the protest. Bid protests can result in significant expenses to us, contract modifications or even loss of the contract award and the resolution can extend the time until contract activity can begin and delay the recognition of sales and defer underlying cash flows and adversely affect our operating results. Our efforts to protest or challenge any bids for contracts that were not awarded to us also may be unsuccessful.
Competition and changing procurement policies could adversely affect our business and financial results.
We operate in a highly competitive industry and our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, technical, marketing and servicing capabilities than we do in certain areas. Our competitors may develop new technologies, products or services that could replace our current offerings. Additionally, if competitors can offer lower cost services and products, or provide services or products more quickly, at equivalent or in some cases even reduced capabilities, we may lose new business opportunities or contract recompetes, which could adversely affect our future results. We are facing increased competition from startups and non-traditional defense contractors, which may have a lower cost structure or be able to move more quickly in addition to being favored, in certain cases, by procurement policy. Furthermore, acquisitions in our industry, including vertical integration, also could result in increased competition or limit our access to certain suppliers without appropriate remedies to protect our interests.
A substantial portion of our business is awarded through competitive bidding. The U.S. Government increasingly has relied on competitive contract award types, including indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity and other multi-award contracts, which have the potential to create pricing pressure and to increase our costs by requiring us to submit multiple bids and proposals. Multi-award contracts require us to make sustained efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. Additionally, procurements that do not evaluate whether the cost assumptions in the bids are realistic can lead to bidders taking aggressive pricing positions, which could result in the winner realizing a loss upon contract award or an increased risk of lower margins or realizing a loss over the term of the contract. Competitors may be willing to accept more risk or lower profitability in competing for contracts than we are. The U.S. Government also may not award us large competitive contracts that we otherwise might have won in an effort to strengthen a broad industrial base.
U.S. Government procurement policies and procedures and the application thereof are regularly changing, and such changes could adversely affect our profitability or the ability to win new business. For example, an increase in the use of contract structures that shift risk to the contractor, such as fixed-price development contracts and incentive-based fee arrangements, or the U.S Government using different award fee criteria than historically used (such as the evaluation of environmental factors) could adversely affect our profit rates or make it more difficult to win new contracts. The DoD is increasingly pursuing rapid acquisition pathways and procedures for new technologies, including through so called “other transaction authority” agreements (OTAs). OTAs are exempt from many traditional procurement laws, including the FAR, and an OTA award may be subject, in certain cases, to the condition that a significant portion of the work under the OTA is performed by a non-traditional defense contractor or that a portion of the cost of the protype project is funded by non-governmental sources. Changes in regulations or interpretations of what are allowable costs under our government contracts could adversely impact our profitability and changes in contract financing policy for fixed-price contracts, such as changes in performance and progress payments policies, could significantly affect the timing of our cash flows.
Our profitability and cash flow may vary based on the mix of our contracts and programs, our performance, and our ability to control costs.
Our profitability and cash flow may vary materially depending on the types of government contracts undertaken, the nature of products produced or services performed under those contracts, the costs incurred in performing the work, the achievement of other performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees is determined, particularly under award and incentive-fee contracts. Failure to perform to customer expectations and contract requirements may result in reduced fees or losses and may adversely affect our financial performance.
Contract types primarily include fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts. Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Cost, schedule or technical performance issues with respect to cost-reimbursable contracts could result in reduced fees, lower profit rates, or program cancellation. Fixed-price contracts are predominantly either firm fixed-price (FFP) contracts or fixed-price incentive (FPI) contracts. Under FFP contracts, we receive a fixed price irrespective of the actual costs we incur and therefore we carry the burden of any cost overruns. Under FPI contracts the U.S. Government is responsible for our costs up to a negotiated ceiling price and we generally share, based on a negotiated sharing formula, savings from cost underruns and expenses, up to the negotiated ceiling price, from cost overruns. We bear the risk for all cost overruns that exceed the negotiated ceiling price. Due to the fixed-price nature of the contracts, if our actual costs exceed our estimates, our margins and profits are reduced and we could incur a reach-forward loss. A reach-forward loss is when estimates of total costs to be incurred on a
contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price. When this occurs, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident.
Under both fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected. Costs to complete a contract may increase for many reasons, including technical and manufacturing challenges, schedule delays, workforce-related issues, inaccurate initial contract cost estimates, the timeliness and availability of materials from suppliers, internal and subcontractor performance or product quality issues, inability to meet cost reduction initiatives or achieve efficiencies from digital transformation, changing laws or regulations, inflation and natural disasters. Certain contracts may impose other risks, such as forfeiting fees, paying penalties, or providing replacement systems in the event of performance failure.
Contracts for development programs include complex design and technical requirements and are often contracted on a cost-reimbursable basis, however, some of our existing development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. In addition, we have certain contracts where we bid upfront on cost-reimbursable development work and the follow-on fixed-price production options in one submission. We expect we also will bid on similar programs in the future. Fixed-price development work or fixed-price production options, especially on competitively bid programs, is inherently riskier than cost-reimbursable work because the revenue is fixed, while the estimates of costs required to complete these contracts are subject to significant variability due to the nature of development programs. The technical complexity coupled with the fixed-price contract structure of certain of our ongoing development programs or new programs increases the risk that our costs will be greater than anticipated, resulting in reduced margins, operating profit, or reach-forward losses during the period of contract performance or upon contract award, all of which could be significant to our financial condition and operating results. Bidding upfront on fixed-price production options increases the risk that we may experience lower margins than expected, or a loss, on the production options because we must estimate the cost of producing a product before it has been developed. These risks may cause us not to bid on certain future programs, which could adversely affect our future growth prospects and financial performance. See Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about losses incurred on certain programs, including fixed-price development programs.
Contracts for the transition from development to production (e.g., low rate initial production (LRIP) contracts) also create performance and financial risks to our business because of the challenge of starting and stabilizing a manufacturing production and test line while concurrently validating final design and managing change in requirements or capabilities requested by the customer.
Many of our contracts include multiple option years exercisable at the customer’s discretion, which carries risk. The customer may decline to exercise an option, or the customer may exercise an option on a contract for which we expect to incur a loss or perform at a low margin, either of which could adversely affect our financial results.
We are routinely subject to audit by our customers on government contracts, including audits relating to our disclosed Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) rate structure or any changes to our CAS rate structure and the results of those audits could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations
U.S. Government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Defense Contract Management Agency and various agency Inspectors General, routinely audit and investigate government contractors. These agencies review a contractor’s compliance with applicable laws, regulations and contract terms, regarding, among other things, contract pricing, contract performance, cost structure and business systems. U.S. Government audits and investigations often take years to complete, and many result in no adverse action against us. Like many U.S. Government contractors, we have received audit and investigative reports recommending the reduction of certain contract prices or that certain payments be repaid, delayed, or withheld, and may involve substantial amounts. Similarly, like other U.S. Government contractors, audits and investigations also occur related to cost reimbursements that are based upon our final allowable incurred costs for each year. We have unaudited or unsettled incurred cost claims related to past years, which limits our ability to issue final billings on contracts for which authorized and appropriated funds may be expiring or can result in delays in final billings and our ability to close out a contract. These audits could result in unanticipated changes to contract prices and the amount and timing of payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.
If an audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, fines or suspension or debarment from doing business with the U.S. Government. Reductions in the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, penalties, and fines could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in any particular reporting period, and suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government. In addition, we could suffer serious reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Similar government oversight and risks to our business and reputation exist in most other countries where we conduct business.
Other Risks Related to our Operations
We are heavily dependent on suppliers and if our subcontractors or other suppliers or teaming agreement or joint venture partners fail to perform their obligations, our performance and ability to win future business could be adversely affected.
We are the prime contractor on most of our contracts and rely on other companies to provide materials, major components and products, and to perform a portion of the services that are provided to our customers under the terms of most of our contracts. These arrangements may involve subcontracts, teaming arrangements, joint ventures, or supply agreements with other companies on which we rely (contracting parties) and, in many cases, our contracting parties in turn rely on lower-tier subcontractors. We sometimes have disputes with our contracting parties, including disputes regarding the cost, quality and timeliness of work performed, workshares, customer concerns about the other party’s performance, issues related to lower-tier subcontractor performance, our failure to issue or extend task orders, or our hiring the personnel of a subcontractor, teammate or joint venture partner or vice versa. We also could be adversely affected by actions or issues experienced by our contracting parties that are outside of our control, such as misconduct and reputational issues involving our contracting parties, which could subject us to liability or adversely affect our ability to compete for contract awards. The financial stability and viability of our contracting parties or lower-tier subcontractors have and in the future could adversely affect their ability to meet their performance obligation.
A failure by one or more of our contracting parties to provide the agreed-upon materials, components or products, or perform the agreed-upon services, on a timely basis, according to specifications, including compliance with regulatory requirements we flow down from our prime contracts, or at all, has and may adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations and require that we transition the work to other companies. Contracting party performance deficiencies may result in additional costs or delays in product deliveries and affect our operating results and could result in a customer terminating our contract for default or convenience. A default termination could expose us to liability and affect our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. A failure by our contracting parties to meet affordability targets could negatively affect our profitability, result in contract losses and affect our ability to win new business.
Additionally, we are affected by government procurement restrictions and issues affecting industry supply chains broadly. For example, U.S. Government statutes and regulations impose restrictions on the sourcing of items from specified countries. We seek to manage supply risk through long-term contracts, identifying domestic or other U.S. allied alternative sources of items and maintaining an acceptable level of our key materials in inventories. Advanced microelectronics, including semiconductors, underpin many of our current and future critical technologies and platforms, and global shortages of these products due to increased demand or other supply chain challenges could result in increased procurement lead times and increased costs and potential shortages, which could affect our performance. We also must comply with specific procurement requirements that can limit the number of eligible suppliers, and a significant number of the components or supplies used are currently single or sole sourced. Because the identification and qualification of new or additional suppliers can take an extended period of time and can result in additional cost, issues with suppliers or trade actions that limit our ability to use certain suppliers, especially when single or sole sourced, can have an adverse impact on our business. Complying with U.S. Government contracting regulations that limit the source or manufacture of suppliers and impose stringent cybersecurity regulations also may create challenges for our supply chain and increase costs.
We remain heavily dependent on our supply chain for sourcing contractually compliant components, which is outside of our direct control and is multi-tiered. The future occurrence of non-compliant components in our programs could cause suspensions in product deliveries, remediation work on installed components, contract price adjustments and alternate supply sourcing, all of which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop new technologies, products and services and efficiently produce and deliver existing products.
Many of the products and services we provide are highly engineered and involve sophisticated technologies with related complex manufacturing and systems integration processes. Our customers’ requirements change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our future performance depends, in part, on our ability to adapt to changing customer needs rapidly, identify emerging technological trends, develop and manufacture innovative products and services efficiently and bring those offerings to market quickly at cost-effective prices. This includes efforts to provide mission solutions that integrate capabilities and resources across all forces and domains, which we refer to as joint all domain operations, and to implement emerging digital and network technologies and capabilities. Artificial intelligence technologies have rapidly developed and our business may be adversely affected if we cannot successfully integrate the technology into our internal business processes and product and service offerings in a timely, cost-effective, compliant and responsible manner. To advance our innovation and position us to meet our customers’ requirements, we make investments in emerging technologies that we believe are needed to keep pace with rapid industry innovation and seek to collaborate with commercial entities that we believe have complementary technologies to ours. These commercial entities may not be accustomed to government contracting and may be unwilling to agree to the government’s customary terms, including with respect to intellectual property, liability and indemnification term, which may
prevent or lessen the benefit of collaboration. We may not be successful in identifying or developing emerging technologies and may spend significant resources on projects that ultimately are unsuccessful or yield a low return on the amount invested.
Our future success in delivering innovative and affordable solutions to our customers relies, in part, on our multi-year business transformation initiative that seeks to significantly enhance our digital infrastructure to increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business while reducing costs. This digital transformation effort requires substantial investment and if we are unable to successfully implement the strategy or do so in a timely manner, our results of operations and future competitiveness may be adversely affected.
If we fail in our development projects or if our new products or technologies fail to achieve customer acceptance or competitors develop more capable technologies or offerings or develop new technologies or offerings faster, we may be unsuccessful in obtaining new contracts or winning all or a portion of next generation programs, including in key areas such as hypersonics and classified work, and this could adversely affect our future performance and financial results.
Geopolitical, macroeconomic and public health events and conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.
Geopolitical
. Changes in U.S. government and other nations’ administration and their associated shifts in policy and priorities could also impact our operations and market conditions. Our business is highly sensitive to geopolitical and security issues, including foreign policy actions taken by governments such as tariffs, sanctions, embargoes, export and import controls, and other trade restrictions, which can affect the demand for, and our ability to sell, our products and services, cause disruptions to our supply chain, and, ultimately, could adversely affect our business.
Global conflicts, including Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East, and heightened tensions in the Pacific region, have significantly elevated global geopolitical tensions and security concerns and resulted in increased demand for some of our products and services. However, if we are unable to increase production to meet demand in the timeframe expected by potential customers, whether due to supply constraints, government funding, or otherwise, then we may lose sales opportunities as those possible customers seek alternatives, even less capable ones, that may be delivered more quickly. Furthermore, the level of continuing demand and our ability to sell to customers to meet that demand is subject in part to changes in government policies and priorities.
Economic sanctions, export controls, and other trade restrictions, for instance those that the U.S. Government and other nations implemented against Russia in light of its invasion of Ukraine or those relating to the conflict in the Middle East, could directly and indirectly result in the disruption of our business and supply chain. Conflicts in Ukraine and elsewhere have increased the threat of malicious cyber activity from nation states and other actors. China has placed restrictions on and sanctioned our company and certain executives in connection with foreign military sales by the U.S. Government to Taiwan involving our products and services. We will continue to follow official U.S. Government guidance as it relates to sales to Taiwan and do not currently expect a material impact to our business from these actions. In 2023, China also implemented broad-based export restrictions on certain minerals used in the production of, among other things, semiconductors and missile systems; in 2024, China specifically banned export of certain minerals to the U.S. China may impose additional sanctions that could adversely affect Lockheed Martin, our suppliers, teammates and/or partners in the future.
Our international sales also could be adversely affected by actions taken by the U.S. Government, including the exercise of foreign policy, Congressional oversight or the financing of particular programs, that may prevent, restrict or otherwise impose conditions upon the sale and delivery of our products or the transfer of sensitive technology. For example, the U.S. Government has imposed certain sanctions on Türkish entities and persons, which has affected our ability to obtain certain U.S. export permits or authorizations necessary to perform under our existing contracts supporting the Türkish Utility Helicopter Program (TUHP), and could impact our work with Türkish industry and our opportunity for sales in Türkiye generally. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on TUHP. Our inability to perform under, or compete for, contracts with international customers because of actions taken by the U.S. Government has resulted and may in the future result in our inability to recover our costs, incurrence of reach-forward losses, claims and contract terminations by these customers and suppliers, and limitations on our ability to pursue new business, which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.
Macroeconomic.
Heightened levels of inflation and the potential worsening of macroeconomic conditions, including slower growth or recession, changes to fiscal and monetary policy, tighter credit, higher interest rates and currency fluctuations, present risks for us, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. If we are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our future profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for existing fixed-price contracts, may be adversely affected. Although we believe defense spending is more resilient to adverse macroeconomic conditions than many other industrial sectors, our suppliers and other partners, many of which are more exposed to commercial markets or have fewer resources, may be adversely impacted to a more significant degree than we are by an economic downturn. Such an impact could affect their performance and adversely impact our operations. In addition, macroeconomic conditions could cause budgetary
pressures for our government customers resulting in reductions or delays in spending, which could adversely impact our business. Higher interest rates increase the borrowing costs on new debt and could affect the fair value of our investments. Interest rates also impact our pension. For example, higher interest rates generally reduce the measure of our gross pension obligations while lower interest rates increase it.
Public health.
We face a wide variety of risks related to public health crises, epidemics, pandemics or similar events. If a new health epidemic or outbreak were to occur, we could experience broad and varied effects similar to the impact of COVID-19, including adverse impacts to our workforce and supply chain, inflationary pressures and increased costs, schedule or production delays, market volatility and other financial ramifications. If any of these were to occur, our future results and performance could be adversely impacted.
International sales may pose different economic, regulatory, competition and other risks.
International sales present risks that are different and potentially greater than those encountered in our U.S. business. In 2024, 26% of our total net sales were associated with international customers. International sales are subject to numerous political and economic factors, including changes in foreign national priorities, foreign government budgets, global economic conditions, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the possibility of trade sanctions and other government actions, regulatory requirements, significant competition, taxation, and other risks associated with doing business outside the U.S. Sales of military products and services and any associated industrial development (offset) agreements are subject to U.S. export regulations and foreign policy, and there could be significant delays or other issues in reaching definitive agreements for announced programs. See the Risk Factor “Geopolitical, macroeconomic and public health events and conditions could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.” Competition for international sales is intense, including from international manufacturers whose governments sometimes provide research and development assistance, marketing subsidies and other assistance for their products and services.
Our international business is conducted through FMS contracted through the U.S. Government and by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. FMS contracts with the U.S. Government are subject to the FAR and the DFARS. Because the U.S. Government functions as an intermediary in FMS sales, we are reliant on, and could be adversely impacted by, the capacity and speed of the DoD’s administration of requests from non-U.S. countries to convert requests to sales. In contrast, DCS transactions represent sales directly to international customers and are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including product testing, import-export control, technology transfer restrictions, investments, taxation, repatriation of earnings, exchange controls, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations, and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Control Reform Act of 2018. While we have extensive policies in place to comply with such laws and regulations, failure by us, our employees or others working on our behalf to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities, including suspension, debarment from bidding for or performing government contracts, or suspension of our export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on us. We frequently team with international subcontractors and suppliers who also are exposed to similar risks.
We believe DCS transactions present a higher level of potential risks because they involve direct commercial relationships with parties with which we typically have less familiarity. Additionally, international procurement and local country rules and regulations, contract laws and judicial systems differ from those in the U.S. and, in some cases, may be less predictable than those in the U.S., which could impair our ability to enforce contracts and increase the risk of adverse or unpredictable outcomes, including the possibility that certain matters that would be considered civil matters in the U.S. are treated as criminal matters in other countries.
In conjunction with defense procurements, some international customers require contractors to comply with industrial cooperation regulations, including entering into industrial participation, industrial development or localization agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements (also known as offset contracts), as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services. These offset agreements generally extend over several years and obligate the contractor to perform certain commitments, which may include in-country purchases, technology transfers, local manufacturing support, consulting support to in-country projects, investments in joint ventures and financial support projects, and preference for local suppliers or subcontractors. The customer’s expectations in respect of the scope of offset commitments can be substantial, including high-value content, and may exceed existing local technical capability. Failure to meet these commitments, which can be subjective and outside of our control, may result in significant penalties, and could lead to a reduction in sales to a country. Furthermore, some of our existing offset agreements are dependent upon the successful operation of joint ventures that we do not control and involve products and services that are outside of our core business, which may increase the risk of breaching our obligations, exposing us to compliance risks of the joint venture, and impairing our ability to recover our investment. For more information on our industrial development obligations, including the notional value of our remaining industrial development obligations and potential penalties for non-compliance, see “Contractual Commitments” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
We may be unable to benefit fully from or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or use third-party intellectual property, which could negatively affect our business.
We own a substantial number of U.S. and foreign patents and trademarks related to the products and services we provide. In addition to owning a large portfolio of patents and trademarks, we develop and own other intellectual property, including copyrights, trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how, which contribute significantly to our business. We also license intellectual property to and from third parties. The FAR and DFARS provide that the U.S. Government obtains certain rights in intellectual property, including patents, developed by us and our subcontractors and suppliers in performance of government contracts or with government funding. The U.S. Government may use, or may authorize others including competitors to use, such intellectual property. Non-U.S. governments also may have certain rights in patents and other intellectual property developed in performance of our contracts with these entities. The U.S. Government is pursuing aggressive positions on the acquisition of broad data and software packages as well as the scope and applicability of these rights once acquired. The DoD is also implementing an overarching intellectual property acquisition policy that will require a greater focus and planning as to intellectual property rights for its programs, with the potential impacts of this policy or any associated regulatory changes on future acquisitions yet to be determined. The DoD’s efforts could affect our ability to protect and exploit our intellectual property and to leverage supplier intellectual property, for example, if we are unable to obtain necessary licenses from our suppliers to meet government requirements. Additionally, third parties may assert that our products or services infringe their intellectual property rights, which could result in costly and time-consuming disputes, subject us to damages and injunctions and adversely affect our ability to compete and perform on certain contracts.
Our business and financial performance depends on us identifying, attracting and retaining a highly skilled workforce.
Our performance is dependent upon us identifying, attracting, developing, motivating and retaining a highly skilled workforce with the requisite skills in multiple areas including engineering, science, manufacturing, information technology, cybersecurity, business development and strategy and management. Due to the national security nature of our work, our performance is also dependent upon personnel who hold security clearances and receive substantial training to work on certain programs or tasks and can be difficult to replace on a timely basis if we experience unplanned attrition. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders in our industry as well as the market for individuals holding high-level security clearances is extremely competitive and not confined to our industry. For example, we compete with commercial technology companies outside of the aerospace and defense industry for qualified technical, cyber and scientific positions, which may not face the same type of cost pressures as a government contractor and which may be able to offer more flexible work arrangements given that certain of our employees must perform the majority of their work in a secure facility because of the need to access classified information. If we cannot adequately attract and retain personnel with the requisite skills or clearances in this competitive market, our performance and future prospects may be adversely affected.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented flexible work arrangements and a hybrid workforce model, where portions of our workforce work remotely while others are required to be on-site in our facilities depending on, among other things, the nature of the job performed, business needs, and evolving circumstances. In conjunction with this, it is critical that we develop and train employees, hire new qualified personnel, and successfully manage the short and long-term transfer of critical knowledge and skills, including leadership development and succession planning throughout our business. While we have processes in place for management transition and the transfer of knowledge and skills, the loss of key personnel, coupled with an inability to adequately train other personnel, hire new personnel or transfer knowledge and skills, could significantly impact our ability to perform under our contracts and execute on new or growing programs.
Additionally, approximately 19% of our workforce is comprised of employees that are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various unions. If we encounter difficulties with renegotiations or renewals of collective bargaining arrangements or are unsuccessful in those efforts, we could incur additional costs and experience work stoppages. Union actions at suppliers also can affect us. Any delays or work stoppages could adversely affect our ability to perform under our contracts, which could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations.
Cyber-attacks and other security threats and disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business.
As an aerospace and defense company, we face a multitude of security threats, including cybersecurity threats ranging from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, to attacks from more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation state actors, some of which target the defense industrial base and other critical infrastructure sectors. The sophistication of the threats continues to evolve and grow, including the risk associated with the use of emerging technologies, such as artificial intelligence and quantum computing, for nefarious purposes. In addition to cybersecurity threats, we face threats to the security of our facilities and employees from terrorist acts, sabotage and other disruptions, any of which could adversely affect our business. The improper conduct of our employees or others working on our
behalf who have access to export controlled, classified or other sensitive information could also adversely affect our business and reputation.
If we are unable to protect sensitive information, including by complying with evolving information security, data protection and privacy regulations and related disclosure requirements, our customers or governmental authorities could investigate the adequacy of our threat mitigation and detection processes and procedures; and could bring actions against us for noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. Moreover, depending on the severity of an incident, our customers’ data, our employees’ data, our intellectual property (including trade secrets and research, development and engineering know-how) and other third-party data (such as that of subcontractors, suppliers and vendors) could be compromised, which could adversely affect our business. Products and services we provide to customers also carry cybersecurity risks, including risks that they could be breached or fail to detect, prevent or combat attacks, which could result in losses to our customers and claims against us, and could harm our relationships with our customers and financial results.
Given the persistence, sophistication, volume and novelty of threats we face, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating an attack that could have a material adverse effect on us and the costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means. The national security aspects of our business and much of the data we protect increase and create different risks relative to other industries. National security considerations may also preclude us from publicly disclosing a cybersecurity incident.
Our customers (including sites that we operate and manage for our customers), suppliers, subcontractors, joint venture partners and acquired entities face similar security threats and an incident at one of these entities could adversely impact our business. These entities are typically outside our control and may have access to our information with varying levels of security and cybersecurity resources, expertise, safeguards and capabilities. Their relationships with government contractors, including us, may increase the risk that they are targeted by the same threats we face, however, they may not be as prepared for such threats. Adversaries actively seek to exploit security and cybersecurity weaknesses in our supply chain. Breaches in our multi-tiered supply chain, which is comprised of thousands of direct and indirect suppliers, have and could in the future compromise our data and adversely affect customer deliverables. We also must rely on our supply chain for adequately detecting and reporting cyber incidents, which could affect our ability to report or respond to cybersecurity incidents effectively or in a timely manner.
For information on our cybersecurity risk management, strategy and governance, see Item 1C. – Cybersecurity.
If we fail to successfully complete or manage acquisitions, divestitures, equity investments and other transactions or if acquired entities or equity investments fail to perform as expected, our financial results, business and future prospects could be harmed.
In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate companies, and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, joint ventures, other investments and divestitures. We seek to identify acquisition or investment opportunities that will expand or complement our existing products and services or customer base, at reasonable valuations. To be successful, we must conduct due diligence to identify valuation issues and potential loss contingencies or underlying risks, some of which are difficult to discover or assess prior to consummation of an acquisition or investment; negotiate transaction terms; complete and close complex transactions; integrate acquired companies and employees; and realize anticipated operating synergies efficiently and effectively. U.S. regulators have increased their scrutiny of mergers and acquisitions in recent years, which could continue to limit our ability to execute certain transactions that we might otherwise pursue.
Acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and investments often require substantial management resources and have the potential to divert our attention from our existing business. Unidentified or identified but uncertain liabilities that are not covered by indemnification or other coverage could adversely affect our future financial results. This is particularly the case in respect of successor liability under procurement laws and regulations such as the False Claims Act or the Truthful Cost or Pricing Data Act (formerly the Truth in Negotiations Act), anti-corruption, environmental, tax, import-export and technology transfer laws, which provide for civil and criminal penalties and the potential for debarment. We also may incur unanticipated costs or expenses, including post-closing asset impairment charges, expenses associated with eliminating duplicate facilities, employee retention, transaction-related or other litigation, and other liabilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business and results of operations.
Joint ventures and other noncontrolling investments operate under shared control with other parties. These investments typically face many of the same risks and uncertainties as we do, but may expose us to additional risks not present if we retained full control. A joint venture partner may have economic or other business interests that are inconsistent with ours and we may be unable to prevent strategic decisions that may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of
operations. We also could be adversely affected by, or liable for, actions taken by these joint ventures that we do not control, including violations of anti-corruption, import and export, taxation and anti-boycott laws.
Depending on our rights and percentage of ownership, we may consolidate the financial results of such entities or account for our interests under the equity method. Under the equity method of accounting for nonconsolidated ventures and investments, we recognize our share of the operating profit or loss of these joint ventures in our results of operations. Our operating results are affected by the conduct and performance of businesses over which we do not exercise control and, as a result, we may not be successful in achieving the growth or other intended benefits of strategic investments.
We make investments in early-stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing new technologies applicable to our business. These investments are generally illiquid at the time of investment and typically we hold a non-controlling interest. We have and expect to continue to recognize gains or losses attributable to adjustments of the investments’ fair value, including impairments up to and including the full value of the investment, which events are generally outside of our control such as the success or failure of the company and market volatility.
Risks Related to Significant Contingencies, Uncertainties and Estimates, including Pension, Taxes, Environmental and Litigation Costs
Pension funding requirements and costs are dependent on return on pension assets and other economic and actuarial assumptions which if changed may cause our future earnings and cash flow to fluctuate significantly and affect the affordability of our products and services.
Many of our employees and retirees participate in defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). The impact of these plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense or income we record for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates and rates of return on plan assets, other actuarial assumptions, including participant longevity (also known as mortality), as well as the timing of cash funding. Changes in these factors, including actual returns on plan assets, may also affect our plan funding, cash flows and stockholders’ equity. We could be required to make pension contributions earlier than and/or in excess of what was planned if our return on pension assets is less than our assumptions, which would reduce our free cash flow.
We have made substantial cash contributions to our plans as required by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and in accordance with U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS), and expect to make future contributions as required or when deemed prudent. We generally can recover a significant portion of these contributions related to our plans as allowable costs on our U.S. Government contracts, including FMS. However, there can be differences between the time when we contribute cash to our plans under pension funding rules and when we recover pension costs under CAS, which can affect the timing of our cash flows. Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense as calculated under CAS while our consolidated financial statements must present pension income or expense in accordance with U.S. GAAP Financial Accounting Standards (FAS); differences in these accounting rules may result in significant period adjustments referred to as our FAS/CAS pension adjustments.
In recent years, we have taken actions intended to mitigate the risk related to our defined benefit pension plans including pension risk transfer transactions whereby we purchase group annuity contracts (GACs) from insurance companies using assets from the pension trust. We expect to continue to evaluate such transactions in the future. Although under the majority of the GACs we have purchased, we are relieved of all responsibility for the associated pension obligations, we have purchased and may in the future purchase GACs whereby the insurance company reimburses the pension plans but we remain responsible for paying benefits under the plans to covered retirees and beneficiaries and are subject to the risk that the insurance company will default on its obligations to reimburse the pension trust. While we believe pension risk transfer transactions are beneficial, future transactions, depending on their size, could result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust and/or require us to recognize noncash settlement charges in earnings in the applicable reporting period.
For more information on how these factors could impact financial condition and results of operations, see “Critical Accounting Policies – Postretirement Benefit Plans” in the MD&A and “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our estimates and projections may prove to be inaccurate and certain of our assets may be at risk of future impairment.
The accounting for some of our most significant activities is based on judgments and estimates, which are complex and subject to many variables. For example, accounting for sales using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method requires that we assess risks and make assumptions regarding future schedule, cost, technical and performance issues for thousands of contracts, many of which are long-term in nature. This process can be especially difficult when estimating costs for development programs because of the inherent uncertainty in developing a new product or technology. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts of revenue and operating profit could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, we initially allocate the purchase price of acquired businesses based on a preliminary assessment of the fair value of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. For acquisitions we may use a one-year measurement period to analyze and assess several factors used in establishing the asset and liability fair values as of the acquisition date which could result in adjustments to asset and liability balances.
We have $11.1 billion of goodwill assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2024 from previous acquisitions, which represents approximately 20% of our total assets. These goodwill assets are subject to annual impairment testing and more frequent testing upon the occurrence of certain events or significant changes in circumstances that indicate goodwill may be impaired. If we experience changes or factors arise that negatively affect the expected cash flows of a reporting unit, we may be required to write off all or a portion of the reporting unit’s related goodwill assets.
Actual financial results could differ from our judgments and estimates. See “Critical Accounting Policies” in the MD&A and Results of Operations and “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies and use of estimates.
Changes in tax laws and regulations or exposure to additional tax liabilities could adversely affect our financial results.
Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including those with retroactive effect, could result in increases in our tax expense and affect profitability and cash flows. For example, beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes (research and development capitalization). While the most significant impact of this provision was to cash tax liability for 2022, the tax year in which the provision took effect, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but decline to an immaterial amount in year six.
The amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans, change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions, and future changes in tax laws. In addition, we are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities. The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and changes to the timing of required tax payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These increases or changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.
Our business involves significant risks and uncertainties that may not be covered by indemnity or insurance.
A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense and technology products and systems. New technologies may be untested or unproven. Failure of some of these products and services could result in extensive loss of life or property damage. Accordingly, we may incur liabilities that are unique to our products and services. In some but not all circumstances, we may be entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers, either through U.S. Government indemnifications under Public Law 85-804, 10 U.S.C. 3861, the Commercial Space Launch Act or the Price-Anderson Act, qualification of our products and services by the Department of Homeland Security under the SAFETY Act provisions of the Homeland Security Act of 2002, contractual provisions or otherwise.
We seek to obtain insurance coverage from established and reputable insurance carriers to the extent available in order to cover these risks and liabilities. However, the amount of insurance coverage that we maintain or that is available to purchase in the market may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities and we may self-insure certain types of risk. Insurance coverage is subject to the terms and conditions of the insurance contract and is further subject to any sublimits, exclusions, restrictions, or defenses, including standard exclusions for acts of war. Existing coverage is renewed annually and may be canceled pursuant to the terms of the policies while we remain exposed to the risk and it is not possible to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks, natural hazards and liabilities. For example, we are limited in the amount of insurance we
can obtain to cover unusually hazardous risks or certain natural hazards such as earthquakes, fires or extreme weather conditions, some of which may be exacerbated by climate change. We have significant operations in geographic areas prone to these risks, such as in California, Florida and Texas, and certain of our properties have suffered damage from natural disasters in the past and may again in the future. We could incur significant costs to improve the climate resiliency of our infrastructure and supply chain and otherwise prepare for, respond to, and mitigate the effects of climate change. In addition, under certain classified fixed-price development and production contracts, we are unable to insure risk of loss to government property because of the classified nature of the contracts and the inability to disclose classified information necessary for underwriting and claims to commercial insurers. Even if insurance coverage is available, we may not be able to obtain it in an amount, at a price or on terms acceptable to us. Some insurance providers may be unable or unwilling to provide us insurance given the nature of our business or products. Additionally, disputes with insurance carriers over coverage terms or the insolvency of one or more of our insurance carriers may significantly affect the amount or timing of our cash flows.
Substantial costs resulting from an accident, failure of or defect in our products or services, natural catastrophe or other incident, or liability arising from our products and services in excess of any legal protection, indemnity, and our insurance coverage (or for which indemnity or insurance is not available or not obtained) could adversely impact our financial condition and operating results. Any accident, failure of, or defect in our products or services, even if fully indemnified or insured, could negatively affect our reputation among our customers and the public and make it more difficult for us to compete effectively. It also could affect the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.
Environmental regulations, including in relation to climate change, could adversely affect our future earnings as well as the affordability of our products and services.
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements for the protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to the complexity and pervasiveness of these requirements, we are a party to or have property subject to various lawsuits, proceedings, and remediation obligations. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We have incurred and will continue to incur liabilities for environmental remediation at some of our current and former facilities and at third-party-owned sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party as a result of our historical activities and those of our predecessor companies. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, and the extent of financial exposure can be difficult to estimate. Among the variables management must assess in evaluating costs associated with these cases and remediation sites are the status of site assessment, extent of the contamination, impacts on natural resources, changing cost estimates, evolution of technologies used to remediate the site, continually evolving environmental standards, availability of insurance coverage and indemnification under existing agreements and cost allowability issues, including varying efforts by the U.S. Government to limit allowability of our costs in resolving liability at third-party-owned sites. Our environmental remediation related liabilities also could increase significantly because of acquisitions, stricter remediation standards for existing or newly regulated substances, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations, or the discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination. For information regarding these matters, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for environmental remediation to the extent probable and estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies – Environmental Matters” in the MD&A and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
We manage and have managed various U.S. Government-owned facilities on behalf of the U.S. Government. At such facilities, environmental compliance and remediation costs historically have been the responsibility of the U.S. Government. We have relied, and continue to rely with respect to past practices, on U.S. Government funding to pay at least a portion if not all of such costs, notwithstanding efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit the U.S. Government’s responsibility. Although the U.S. Government remains responsible for capital and operating costs associated with environmental compliance, responsibility for fines and penalties associated with environmental noncompliance typically is borne by either the U.S. Government or the contractor, depending on the contract and the relevant facts. Some environmental laws include criminal provisions. A conviction under environmental law could affect our ability to be awarded future or perform under existing U.S. Government contracts.
The increasing global regulatory focus on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and their potential impacts relating to climate change could result in laws, regulations or policies that significantly increase our direct and indirect operational and compliance burdens, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. These laws, regulations or policies could take many forms, including carbon taxes, cap and trade regimes, increased efficiency standards, GHG reduction commitments, incentives or mandates for particular types of energy, disclosure requirements or changes in procurement laws. Changes in government procurement laws that mandate or take into account climate change considerations, such as the contractor’s GHG emissions, GHG emission reduction targets, lower emission products or other climate risks, in evaluating
bids could result in costly changes to our operations or affect our competitiveness on future bids, or our ability to bid at all. In addition to incurring direct costs to implement any climate-change related laws, regulations or policies, we may see indirect costs rise, such as increased energy or material costs, as a result of policies affecting other sectors of the economy. Although most of these increased costs likely would be recoverable through pricing, to the extent that the increase in our costs as a result of these policies are greater than our competitors, we may be less competitive on future bids or the total increased cost in our industry’s products and services could result in lower demand from our customers. We monitor developments in climate change-related laws, regulations and policies for their potential effect on us, however, we currently are not able to accurately predict the materiality of any potential costs associated with such developments. In addition, climate change-related litigation and investigations have increased in recent years and any claims or investigations against us could be costly to defend and our business could be adversely affected by the outcome.
We are involved in a number of legal proceedings. We cannot predict the outcome of litigation and other contingencies with certainty.
Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of legal proceedings and other contingencies that cannot be predicted with certainty. As required by U.S. GAAP, we estimate loss contingencies and establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies where liability is deemed probable and reasonably estimable considering the facts and circumstances known to us at a particular point in time. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings may affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a liability or as a reserve against assets in our financial statements. For a description of our current legal proceedings, see Item 3 – Legal Proceedings, “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters” in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Risks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock
There can be no assurance that we will continue to increase our dividend or to repurchase shares of our common stock.
Cash dividend payments and share repurchases are subject to limitations under applicable laws and the discretion of our Board of Directors and are determined after considering then-existing conditions, including earnings, other operating results and capital requirements and cash deployment alternatives. Our payment of dividends and share repurchases could vary from historical practices or our stated expectations. Decreases in asset values or increases in liabilities, including liabilities associated with employee benefit plans and assets and liabilities associated with taxes, can reduce net earnings and stockholders’ equity. Under certain circumstances, a deficit in stockholders’ equity could limit our ability to pay dividends and make share repurchases under Maryland state law in the future. In addition, the timing and amount of share repurchases under Board of Directors approved share repurchase plans may differ from stated expectations and is within the discretion of management and will depend on many factors, including our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future or to borrow money from available financing sources, our results of operations, capital requirements and applicable law.
ITEM 1B.    Unresolved Staff Comments
None.
ITEM 1C.    Cybersecurity
Risk Management and Strategy
We believe cybersecurity is critical to advancing our 21st Century Security vision and enabling our digital transformation efforts. As an aerospace and defense company, we face a multitude of cybersecurity threats that range from attacks common to most industries, such as ransomware and denial-of-service, to attacks from more advanced and persistent, highly organized adversaries, including nation state actors, some of which target the defense industrial base and other critical infrastructure sectors. Our customers, suppliers, subcontractors and joint venture partners face similar cybersecurity threats, and a cybersecurity incident impacting us or any of these entities could materially adversely affect our operations, performance and results of operations. These cybersecurity threats and related risks make it imperative that we strive to be a leader in the information security field, and we expend considerable resources on cybersecurity.
Our corporate information security organization has implemented a governance structure and processes to assess, identify, manage and report cybersecurity risks. We also have a corporate-wide counterintelligence and insider threat detection program to proactively identify external and internal threats and mitigate those threats in a timely manner. As a defense contractor, we must comply with extensive regulations, including requirements imposed by the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) related to adequately safeguarding controlled unclassified information (CUI) and reporting cybersecurity incidents to the DoD. We have implemented cybersecurity policies and frameworks based on industry and governmental
standards to align closely with DoD requirements, instructions and guidance. Moreover, we continue to work with the DoD on assessing cybersecurity risk and on policies and practices aimed at mitigating these risks. For example, we have worked in collaboration with the other members of the defense industrial base to support DoD’s development of the Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (CMMC) program, DoD’s program to ensure members of the defense industrial base meet cybersecurity requirements for handling CUI and federal contract information. We believe we are well positioned to meet the requirements of the CMMC and are preparing for certification. In addition to following DoD guidance and implementing pre-existing third party frameworks, we have developed our own practices and frameworks, which we believe enhance our ability to identify and manage cybersecurity risks. For example, we use a proactive risk management strategy that we developed and implemented called the Intelligence Driven Defense
®
model that seeks to identify and prevent cybersecurity incidents by understanding the nature of adversaries and using this information to minimize the impact of an attack.
Third parties
also play a role in our cybersecurity. We engage third-party services to conduct evaluations of our security controls, whether through penetration testing, independent audits or consulting on best practices to address new challenges. These evaluations include testing both the design and operational effectiveness of security controls. We also share and receive threat intelligence with our defense industrial base peers, government agencies, information sharing and analysis centers and cybersecurity associations.
We rely heavily on our supply chain to deliver our products and services to our customers, and a cybersecurity incident at a supplier, subcontractor, joint venture partner, or service provider could materially adversely impact us. We assess
third party
cybersecurity controls through a cybersecurity questionnaire and include security and privacy addendums to our contracts where applicable. We also contractually flow cybersecurity regulatory requirements to our subcontractors as required by the DFARS and other government agency specific requirements. These contractual flow downs include the requirement that our subcontractors implement certain security controls, and that our subcontractors self-report the status of their implementation of these controls to the U.S. Government. These government contracting regulations may create challenges for our supply chain and increase costs. We also require that our subcontractors report cybersecurity incidents to us so that we can assess the impact of the incident on us. For select suppliers, we engage third-party cybersecurity monitoring and alerting services, and seek to work directly with those suppliers to address potential deficiencies identified. We also make available cybersecurity education and awareness materials and briefings to our suppliers.
Governance
The Board of Directors oversees management’s processes for identifying and mitigating risks, including cybersecurity risks, to help align our risk exposure with our strategic objectives.
Senior leadership, including our Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), regularly briefs the Board of Directors on our cybersecurity and information security posture and the Board of Directors is apprised of cybersecurity incidents deemed to have a moderate or higher business impact, even if immaterial to us. The Classified Business and Security Committee of the Board of Directors is briefed by senior leadership, as appropriate, on the cybersecurity of classified programs and the security of our classified business supply chain. Other than oversight of classified business cybersecurity, the full Board retains oversight of cybersecurity because of its importance to Lockheed Martin and the heightened risk in the aerospace and defense industry.
In the event of an incident, we intend to follow our detailed incident response playbook, which outlines the steps to be followed from incident detection to mitigation, recovery and notification, including notifying functional areas (e.g., legal), as well as senior leadership, the Board, and regulators, as appropriate.
Our corporate information security organization, led by our
CISO
, is responsible for our overall information security strategy, policy, security engineering, operations and cyber threat detection and response.
The current CISO has extensive information technology and program management experience, and has served many years in our corporate information security organization.
The corporate information security organization manages and continually enhances a robust enterprise security structure with the ultimate goal of preventing cybersecurity incidents to the extent feasible, while simultaneously increasing our system resilience in an effort to minimize the business impact should an incident occur. Central to this organization is our computer incident response team (CIRT), which is responsible for the protection, detection and response capabilities used in the defense of Lockheed Martin’s data and enterprise computing networks. Employees outside of our corporate information security organization also have a role in our cybersecurity defenses and they are immersed in a corporate culture supportive of security, which we believe improves our cybersecurity.
Assessing, identifying and managing cybersecurity related risks are integrated into our overall enterprise risk management (ERM) process.
Cybersecurity related risks are included in the risk universe that the ERM function evaluates to assess top risks to the enterprise on an annual basis. To the extent the ERM process identifies a heightened cybersecurity related risk, risk owners are assigned to develop risk mitigation plans, which are then tracked to completion.
The ERM process’s annual risk assessment and relevant mitigations are presented to the
Board of Directors
.
Notwithstanding the extensive approach we take to cybersecurity, we may not be successful in preventing or mitigating a cybersecurity incident that could have a material adverse effect on us. While Lockheed Martin maintains cybersecurity
insurance, the costs related to cybersecurity threats or disruptions may not be fully insured.
See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of cybersecurity risks.
ITEM 2.

We believe our facilities are in good condition and adequate for their current use. We may add, improve, replace, or reduce facilities as considered appropriate to meet the needs of our operations.
ITEM 3.
Legal Proceedings
We are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment, and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters will have a material adverse effect on the corporation as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings and cash flows in any particular interim reporting period. We cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty.
We are subject to federal, state, local and foreign requirements for the protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. Due in part to the complexity and pervasiveness of these requirements, we are a party to or have property subject to various lawsuits, proceedings and remediation obligations. The extent of our financial exposure cannot in all cases be reasonably estimated at this time.
For information regarding the matters discussed above, including current estimates of the amounts that we believe are required for remediation or clean-up to the extent estimable, see “Critical Accounting Policies - Environmental Matters” in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are incorporated herein by reference.

The MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in Item 8 - Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.
The MD&A generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results or Operations” in the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 filed with the SEC on January 23, 2024.
Business Overview
We are a global aerospace and defense company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. Our main areas of focus are in defense, space, intelligence, homeland security and information technology, including cybersecurity. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. In 2024, 73% of our $71.0 billion in net sales were from the U.S. Government, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor (including 65% from the Department of Defense (DoD)), 26% were from international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) and 1% were from U.S. commercial and other customers.
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, Missiles and Fire Control (MFC), Rotary and Mission Systems (RMS) and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of the products and services offered.
Our 21st Century Security
®
vision is to accelerate the adoption of advanced networking and other leading-edge technologies into the American defense enterprise, while enhancing the performance and value of our platforms and products for our customers. The aim of 21st Century Security is to integrate and continuously upgrade new and existing systems across all domains with advanced, open-architecture networking and operational technologies that make defense forces more agile, adaptive and unpredictable, enabling overmatch and strengthening deterrence today and into the future.
21st Century Security guides our strategy and investments. As our growth pillars continue to evolve, we are focusing on advancing all-domain mission solutions through investments in digital technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI)/Machine Learning (ML), Autonomy and Crewed/Uncrewed Teaming, Generative Design and other technologies and capabilities enabling Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control (CJADC2). Innovations in these areas will expand capability, improve interoperability, increase demand for our multi-domain solutions and drive efficient conversion of backlog into growth across our portfolio. We have well established programs across our business segments that continue to experience growth, including F-35 sustainment activity (Aeronautics); increased Patriot Advanced Capability-3 (PAC-3) production rates and increased demand for High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS
®
) and Guided Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (GMLRS) (Missiles and Fire Control); radar surveillance systems and CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter (Rotary and Mission Systems); and the modernization of and enhancements to the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM) (Space). Additionally, our teams continue to transform our products and rapidly innovate for the future, developing 6th generation air dominance technologies within Skunk Works
®
, demonstrating autonomous capabilities with the X-62A (F-16) and optionally piloted BLACK HAWK
®
, creating new Joint All-Domain Operating systems with Defense of Guam and AIR 6500 in Australia, establishing small-to-medium satellite capabilities to support proliferated space constellations and advancing hypersonic capabilities. Finally, we are always in pursuit of new program awards to develop future platforms that enable us to continue to strengthen our national defense and advance deterrence and global security.
Keys to enabling success of our strategy include developing and investing in differentiating technologies, forging strategic partnerships, including with commercial companies, executing on our multi-year business transformation initiative to enhance our digital infrastructure and increase efficiencies and collaboration throughout our business and maintaining fiscal discipline. Underpinning our ability to execute our strategy is our talent and culture. We invest substantially in our people to ensure that our workforce has the technical skills necessary to succeed, and we expect to continue to invest internally in innovative technologies that address rapidly evolving mission requirements for our customers. We also will continue to evaluate our portfolio and will make strategic acquisitions or divestitures, as appropriate, while deepening our connection to commercial industry through cooperative partnerships, joint ventures and equity investments.
Portfolio Shaping Activities
We continuously strive to strengthen our portfolio of products and services to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We accomplish this in part by our independent research and development activities and through acquisition, divestiture and internal realignment activities.
We selectively pursue the acquisition of businesses, investments and ventures at attractive valuations that will expand or complement our current portfolio and allow access to new customers or technologies. We also may explore the divestiture of businesses, investments or ventures that no longer meet our needs or strategy or that could perform better outside of our organization or with a different owner. In pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments.
On September 9, 2024, we completed the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business, which was part of our Aeronautics business segment. We received $170 million in cash from the sale. Gains recognized from the sale in 2024 were not significant. The final gain is subject to certain post-closing adjustments, including final working capital, indemnification, and tax adjustments, which we expect to complete in 2025. This sale did not represent a strategic shift and the impacts to our consolidated results of operation, financial position, and cash were not significant. Accordingly, the operating results and cash flows for the CES business up to the divestiture date have not been reclassified to discontinued operations.
On October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $314 million, which will be included in our Space business segment. Terran Orbital’s product and service offerings include satellite design, production, launch planning, mission operations, and on-orbit support for the aerospace and defense industries. We believe this acquisition will enable us to broaden our capabilities and offerings, provide additional innovative solutions to meet our customers’ emerging requirements, and provide expanded opportunities for our combined employees. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the acquisition of Terran Orbital.
U.S. Budget Environment
With approximately three quarters of our sales from the U.S. Government, U.S. Government spending levels, particularly defense spending, and timely funding thereof can affect our financial performance over the short and long term.
On March 22, 2024, the President signed into law the second Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 Consolidated Appropriations package, which includes the DoD funding. This legislation reflects the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 (FRA) spending limit of $886 billion for National Defense, of which $842 billion was for the DoD base budget.
The President’s FY 2025 budget request was submitted to Congress on March 11, 2024, initiating the FY 2025 defense authorization and appropriations legislative process. The request included $895 billion for National Defense, of which $850 billion is for the DoD base budget, in keeping with the limit established by the FRA. While compression on overall requirements driven by the FRA limit is evident, the Office of the Secretary of Defense has stated the FY 2025 budget proposal meets their objectives of keeping National Defense Strategy priorities on track.
On April 24, 2024, the President signed a bill providing a total of $95 billion in additional supplemental funding for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan, including funding for the restock of U.S. munitions capacity. Supplemental funding legislation is not subject to the FRA limits.
The House and Senate continue the legislative process on the FY 2025 budget. The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2025, signed by the President on December 24, 2024, is consistent with the FY 2025 President’s Budget Request (PBR) and Congressionally mandated budget caps established by the FRA with a topline of $849.8 billion. The House Appropriations Committee also marked its bill at this same level. The Senate Appropriations Committee, however, did not adhere to the FRA spending caps and marked budgets above the PBR, providing between a $21 billion and $25 billion increase over the PBR level. Regardless of toplines, all four Committees support additional funding for several of our programs, spread across our four business areas.
Congress still needs to approve or revise the President’s FY 2025 budget proposal through enactment of appropriations bills and other policy legislation, which would then require final approval from the President in order for the FY 2025 budget process to conclude. A second Continuing Resolution (CR) for FY 2025 passed the House and Senate on December 20, 2024, and was signed by the President on December 21, 2024. The bill funds U.S. Government operations through March 14, 2025. In addition to the Continuing Resolution, the President also signed the Disaster Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act on December 21, 2024, which includes more than $100 billion in supplemental funding. Of note, the final version of the bill did
not address the debt ceiling, which is set to expire mid-January 2025 and is expected to cause challenges at the start of the 119th Congressional negotiations. Once the debt ceiling is reached, Treasury may have to use extraordinary measures to prevent default. Treasury’s available cash and any extraordinary measures taken should delay the risk of default for at least several months after the end of the first quarter of 2025. In the upcoming months, the new Congress will return to the task of funding the U.S. Government for the balance of FY 2025. Significant differences that must be resolved include the different allocations as noted above and policy matters that arose during consideration of the CR and the underlying bills.
We anticipate the federal budget will continue to be subject to debate and compromise shaped by, among other things, the new Administration and Congress, the global security environment, inflationary pressures, and macroeconomic conditions. The result may be shifting funding priorities, which could have material impacts on defense spending broadly and our programs.
Geopolitical and Economic Environment
We operate in a complex and evolving global security environment and our business is affected by geopolitical and security issues. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, conflicts in the Middle East and heightened tension in the Pacific region have elevated global security concerns resulting in increased interest for our products and services as countries seek to improve their security posture. In this context, the U.S. Government, our largest customer, continues to align its budget with the defense priorities set forth in the 2022 National Defense Strategy. In addition, security assistance provided by the U.S. Government and its allies to Ukraine has increased U.S. Government and allied demand to replenish U.S. stockpiles, resulting in additional and potential future orders, including for the ramp-up in production capacity for certain products. We continue to expect additional orders over the next several years attributable to the global threat environment. We operate primarily in a long-cycle business and the U.S. Government has been focused on increasing industry capacity to meet demand. We continue to work with the U.S. Government and our supply chain to evaluate increases in capacity at our operations to anticipate potential demand and enable us to deliver critical capabilities.
Our business and financial performance is also affected by general economic conditions. We continue to experience supply chain challenges, including supplier shortages and performance issues. These issues have delayed certain customer deliveries, have been a limiting factor on our ability to ramp up production in response to customer demand for certain products and have caused out-of-sequence manufacturing, which increases costs and decreases operational efficiency. In addition, elevated levels of inflation and macroeconomic conditions present risks for us, our suppliers and the stability of the broader defense industrial base. Certain costs, including rising labor rates and supplier costs, have increased as a result of inflation, and have adversely affected our margins on certain programs. In addition, some suppliers are reducing the duration of pricing validity of their proposals to us or seeking to reopen pricing on existing agreements, which is operationally challenging and increases the risk of cost volatility. We continue to work to mitigate challenges caused by the supply chain or current macroeconomic environment on our business, including by supporting small business and at-risk suppliers, deploying resources to work with our supply chain, securing materials and support by executing long-term contracts, enforcing existing contract terms, identifying alternative sources, collaborating with our customers to address industry-wide challenges, and optimizing our supply chain organization through digital transformation and workforce development. If we experience significant supply chain issues or high rates of inflation, and are unable to successfully mitigate the impact, our future profits, margins and cash flows, particularly for existing fixed-price contracts, may be adversely affected. Inflation and higher interest rates can also constrain the overall purchasing power of our customers for our products and services potentially impacting future orders, especially in a budget constrained environment. We remain committed to our ongoing efforts to increase the efficiency of our operations and improve the cost competitiveness and affordability of our products and services, which may, in part, offset cost increases from inflation.
International Business
A key component of our strategic plan is to grow our international sales. To accomplish this growth, we continue to focus on strengthening our relationships internationally through partnerships and joint technology efforts. Our international business is conducted either by FMS contracted through the U.S. Government or by direct commercial sales (DCS) to international customers. In 2024, approximately 73% of our sales to international customers were FMS and about 27% were DCS. Additionally, in 2024, substantially all of our sales from international customers were in our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments. Space’s sales from international customers were not material in 2024. See Item 1A - Risk Factors for a discussion of risks related to international sales.
In 2024, international customers accounted for 32% of Aeronautics’ net sales. There continues to be strong international interest in the F-35 program, which includes commitments from the U.S. Government and seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers, as well as expressions of interest from other countries. The U.S. Government and the partner countries continue to work together on the design, testing, production and sustainment of the F-35 program. Other areas of
international expansion at our Aeronautics business segment include the F-16 and C-130J programs, which continue to draw interest from international customers for new aircraft.
In 2024, international customers accounted for 29% of MFC’s net sales. Our MFC business segment continues to generate significant international interest, most notably in the air and missile defense product line, which produces the PAC-3 and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) systems. Seventeen nations have chosen PAC-3 Cost Reduction Initiative (CRI) and PAC-3 Missile Segment Enhancement (MSE) to provide missile defense capabilities. Additionally, we continue to see international demand for our tactical and strike missile products, where we received orders from Poland for precision fire systems and for Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM).
In 2024, international customers accounted for 32% of RMS’ net sales. Our RMS business segment continues to experience international interest in the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System (Aegis) for which we perform activities in the development, production, modernization, ship integration, test and lifetime support for ships of international customers such as Japan, Spain, the Republic of Korea and Australia. We have ongoing combat systems programs associated with different classes of surface combatant ships for customers in Canada, Chile and New Zealand. Our Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC) program will provide surface combatant ships for international customers, such as the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, designed to operate in shallow waters and the open ocean. In our training and logistics solutions portfolio, we have active programs and pursuits in the United Kingdom, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Canada, Singapore, Australia, Germany and France. We have active development, production and sustainment support of the S-70 Black Hawk and MH-60 Seahawk helicopters to international customers, including India, Philippines, Australia, the Republic of Korea, Thailand, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Greece. Commercial aircraft are sold to international customers to support search and rescue missions as well as VIP and offshore oil and gas transportation.
Status of the F-35 Program
The F-35 program primarily consists of production contracts, sustainment activities, and new development efforts. Production of the aircraft is expected to continue for many years given the U.S. Government’s objective of procuring 2,456 aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, U.S. Marine Corps, and U.S. Navy. We also have commitments from seven international partner countries and twelve FMS customers. We continue to see strong international demand for the F-35, with the Czech Republic signing an LOA in January 2024 to procure 24 F-35s, Singapore announcing in February 2024 its intent to purchase eight additional F-35s, and Greece signing an LOA in July 2024 to procure 20 F-35s. In November 2024, Romania signed an LOA to procure 32 aircraft, becoming the 20th nation to join the F-35 program. We expect international interest to continue to expand in the coming years.
From program inception through December 31, 2024, we have delivered 1,102 production F-35 aircraft, including 797 F-35A variants, 203 F-35B variants and 102 F-35C variants, and our backlog as of that date was 408 aircraft, demonstrating the F-35 program’s continued progress and longevity. We resumed F-35 deliveries in the third quarter of 2024, after delivering none in the first half of the year, and delivered 106 Technology Refresh 3 (TR-3) configured aircraft and four TR-2 configured aircraft in 2024. We continue to advance TR-3 and Block 4 capabilities to support our customers’ mission requirements.
In December 2024, Lockheed Martin and the Joint Program Office (JPO) reached an agreement for an undefinitized contract action for Lot 18 F-35 Air Vehicle Production Contract for 145 aircraft. The scope includes aircraft for the U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marines and the International Partners and Foreign Military Sales (FMS) customers, in addition to the required infrastructure for the international Final Assembly and Checkout Facilities (FACOs) and other equipment. While we continue to engage with the U.S. Government to definitize the contract, this agreement allowed us to recognize approximately $700 million of sales and associated operating profit deferred from the third quarter of 2024 into the fourth quarter of 2024. We were also able to invoice and collect cash of approximately $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter for costs incurred. Lot 19 was negotiated concurrently with Lot 18, and both Lots are expected to be fully awarded in 2025.
The F-35 program is significant and complex and we and our customers continually review aircraft performance, program and delivery schedule, cost and supply chain issues, and requirements as part of our internal program management efforts and the DoD, Congressional and international countries’ oversight and budgeting processes. Areas of particular focus currently include Lockheed Martin’s and our suppliers’ performance, software maturation related to TR-3 capability and software development more generally, flight test execution, cost of life cycle operations, sustainment, inflation-related cost and supply chain-related cost and schedule pressures, and efforts to increase affordability.
Backlog
At December 31, 2024, our backlog was $176.0 billion compared with $160.6 billion at December 31, 2023. Backlog is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. We expect to recognize approximately 35%
of our backlog over the next 12 months and approximately 60% over the next 24 months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
Our backlog includes both funded (firm orders for our products and services for which funding has been both authorized and appropriated by the customer) and unfunded (firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated) amounts. We do not include unexercised options or potential orders under indefinite-delivery, indefinite-quantity (IDIQ) agreements in our backlog. If any of our contracts with firm orders were to be terminated, our backlog would be reduced by the expected value of the unfilled orders of such contracts. Funded backlog was $107.8 billion at December 31, 2024, as compared to $107.4 billion at December 31, 2023. For backlog related to each of our business segments, see below.
Consolidated Results of Operations
Our operating cycle is primarily long-term and involves many types of contracts for the design, development and manufacture of products and related activities with varying delivery schedules. Consequently, the results of operations of a particular year, or year-to-year comparisons of sales and profits, may not be indicative of future operating results. The following discussions of comparative results should be reviewed in this context. All per share amounts cited in these discussions are presented on a “per diluted share” basis, unless otherwise noted. Our consolidated results of operations were as follows (in millions, except per share data):
Certain amounts reported in other income, net, including our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees, are included in the operating profit of our business segments. Accordingly, such amounts are included in the discussion of our business segment results of operations.
Net Sales
We generate sales from the delivery of products and services to our customers. Our consolidated net sales were as follows (in millions):
Substantially all of our contracts are accounted for using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we record net sales on contracts over time based upon our progress towards completion on a particular contract, as well as our estimate of the profit to be earned at completion. The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated net sales should be read in tandem with the subsequent discussion of changes in our consolidated cost of sales and our business segment results of operations because changes in our sales are typically accompanied by a corresponding change in our cost of sales due to the nature of the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method.
Product Sales
Product sales increased $3.0 billion, or 5%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher product sales of approximately $1.4 billion at MFC, $1.1 billion at RMS and $840 million at Aeronautics. Higher product sales at MFC were due to production ramp up on GMLRS, HIMARS, JASSM and LRASM programs. Higher product sales at RMS were primarily due to higher volume on radar programs, new program ramp up within the laser systems portfolio and higher production volume on CH-53K program, partially offset by lower volume on the VH-92A program. Higher product sales at Aeronautics were due to higher volume on F-35 production contracts.
Service Sales
Service sales increased $460 million, or 4%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase in service sales was primarily due to higher sales of approximately $305 million at Aeronautics and $150 million at Space. Higher service sales at Aeronautics were due to higher volume on F-35 sustainment contracts. Higher service sales at Space were due to higher volume on national security space services.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales, for both products and services, consist of materials, labor, subcontracting costs and an allocation of indirect costs (overhead and general and administrative), as well as the costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers. For each of our contracts, we monitor the nature and amount of costs at the contract level, which form the basis for estimating our total costs to complete the contract. Our consolidated cost of sales was as follows (in millions):
The following discussion of material changes in our consolidated cost of sales for products and services should be read in tandem with the preceding discussion of changes in our consolidated net sales and our business segment results of operations. Except for potential impacts to our programs resulting from supply chain disruptions and inflation, we have not identified any additional developing trends in cost of sales for products and services that would have a material impact on our future operations.
Product Costs
Product costs increased approximately $4.6 billion, or 9%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher product costs of $2.5 billion at MFC, $1.2 billion at Aeronautics and $1.1 billion at RMS. Higher product costs at MFC were due to $1.4 billion in reach-forward losses on a classified program and production ramp up as described above in “Product Sales”. Higher product costs at Aeronautics were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in “Product Sales” and $555 million of losses recognized on a classified contract. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further details about classified program losses incurred at MFC and Aeronautics. Higher product costs at RMS were due to higher volume and production ramp up as described above in “Product Sales”.
Service Costs
Service costs increased approximately $190 million, or 2%, in 2024 as compared to 2023. The increase was primarily attributable to higher service costs of approximately $235 million at Aeronautics due to higher volume as described above in “Service Sales”.
Impairment and Severance Charges
We recorded charges totaling $87 million ($69 million, or $0.29 per share, after-tax) in 2024 and $92 million
(
$73 million
, or
$0.30 per share, after-tax) in 2023. See “Note 16 – Impairment and Severance Charges” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Other Unallocated, Net
Other unallocated, net primarily includes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment (which represents the difference between total CAS pension cost recorded in our business segments’ results of operations and the service cost component of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) pension income (expense)), stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities for deferred compensation plans, intangible asset amortization expense and other corporate costs. These items are not allocated to the business segments and, therefore, are not allocated to cost of sales for products or services. Other unallocated, net reduced cost of sales by $1.0 billion in 2024, compared to $1.2 billion in 2023. The decrease in other unallocated, net was primarily due to lower gains from the changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities related to deferred compensation plans in 2024 compared to in 2023 and fluctuations in costs associated with various corporate items, none of which were individually significant.
Other Income, Net
Other income, net in 2024 was $83 million, compared to $28 million in 2023. Other income, net primarily includes earnings generated by equity method investees, as well as gains or losses for acquisitions, divestitures, and other items, none of which are individually significant. The increase in other income, net in 2024 resulted primarily from the favorable settlement of an intellectual property related matter and higher earnings generated by equity method investees.
Interest Expense
Interest expense in 2024 was $1.0 billion, compared to $916 million in 2023. The increase in interest expense in 2024 resulted primarily from the issuance of senior unsecured notes in December 2024, January 2024 and May 2023. See “Capital Structure, Resources and Other” included within the “Liquidity and Cash Flows” discussion below and “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our debt.
Non-Service FAS Pension Income
Non-service FAS pension income in 2024 was $62 million, compared to $443 million in 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a lower prior service credit amortization and a reduced asset base as detailed in “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Non-operating Income (Expense), Net
Other non-operating income (expense), net primarily includes gains or losses related to changes in the fair value of early-stage company investments or gains or losses upon the sale of these investments. Other non-operating income, net in 2024 was $181 million, compared to $64 million in 2023. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Income Tax Expense
Our effective income tax rate was 14.2% for 2024 and 14.5% for 2023. The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income,
research and development tax credits,
dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature and employee equity awards.
Changes in U.S. (federal or state) or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application (including those with retroactive effect), such as the amortization for research and development expenditures, could significantly impact our provision for income taxes, the amount of taxes payable, our deferred tax asset and liability balances, and stockholders’ equity. In addition to future changes in tax laws, the amount of net deferred tax assets will change periodically based on several factors, including the measurement of our postretirement benefit plan obligations, actual cash contributions to our postretirement benefit plans and the change in the amount or reevaluation of uncertain tax positions.
Beginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the option to deduct research and development expenditures immediately in the year incurred and requires taxpayers to amortize such expenditures over five years for tax purposes. In 2024, research and development capitalization resulted in a cash tax liability of approximately $370 million and our net deferred tax assets increased by a similar amount. While the largest impact of this provision was to the 2022 cash tax liability, the impact will continue over the five-year amortization period, but will decrease over the period and be immaterial by 2027.
We are regularly under audit or examination by tax authorities, including foreign tax authorities (Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, the United Kingdom, and other countries). The final resolution of tax audits and any related administrative reviews or litigation could result in unanticipated increases in our tax expense and changes to the timing of required tax payments, which could affect profitability and cash flows for any particular reporting period. These increases or changes could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in such period.
The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has a framework to implement a global minimum corporate tax of 15% applied on a country-by-country basis for companies with global revenues and profits above certain thresholds (referred to as Pillar 2), with certain aspects of Pillar 2 effective January 1, 2024 and other aspects effective January 1, 2025. While the United States has not enacted legislation to adopt Pillar 2 and it is uncertain if it will do so in the future, certain countries in which we operate have enacted such legislation, and other countries are in the process of doing so. We do not expect Pillar 2 to have a material impact on our effective tax rate or our financial condition and results of operation.
Net Earnings
We reported net earnings of $5.3 billion ($22.31 per share) in 2024 and $6.9 billion ($27.55 per share) in 2023. Net earnings and earnings per share in 2024 were affected by the factors mentioned above. Earnings per share also benefited from a net decrease of approximately 12.0 million weighted average common shares outstanding in 2024 compared to 2023. The reduction in weighted average common shares outstanding was a result of share repurchases, partially offset by share issuance under our stock-based awards and certain defined contribution plans.
Business Segment Results of Operations
We operate in four business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered.
Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management’s evaluation of performance of each segment. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.
Business segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment described below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) or portions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR), and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.
Sales, cost of sales and operating profit for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions):
(a)
See “Consolidated Results of Operations – Severance and Other Charges” discussion above for information on charges related to certain severance and other actions across our organization.
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under CAS, which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit plan income calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense) and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension income components are included in non-service FAS pension income in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense), we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment.
The total FAS/CAS pension adjustments, including the service and non-service cost components of FAS pension income (expense) for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, were as follows (in millions):
The total FAS/CAS pension adjustment in 2022 reflects a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $1.5 billion ($1.2 billion, or $4.33 per share, after-tax) recognized in connection with the transfer of $4.3 billion of our gross defined benefit pension obligations and related plan assets to an insurance company in the second quarter of 2022. See “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
The following segment discussions include information relating to backlog for each segment. Also see “Backlog” discussion above.
Management evaluates performance on our contracts by focusing on net sales and operating profit and not by type or amount of operating expense. Consequently, our discussion of business segment performance focuses on net sales and operating profit, consistent with our approach for managing the business. This approach is consistent throughout the life cycle of our contracts, as management assesses the bidding of each contract by focusing on net sales and operating profit and monitors performance on our contracts in a similar manner through their completion.
We regularly provide customers with reports of our costs as the contract progresses. The cost information in the reports is accumulated in a manner specified by the requirements of each contract. For example, cost data provided to a customer for a product would typically align to the subcomponents of that product (such as a wing-box on an aircraft) and for services would align to the type of work being performed (such as aircraft sustainment). Our contracts generally allow for the recovery of costs in the pricing of our products and services. Most of our contracts are bid and negotiated with our customers under circumstances in which we are required to disclose our estimated total costs to provide the product or service. This approach for negotiating contracts with our U.S. Government customers generally allows for recovery of our actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. We also may enter into long-term supply contracts for certain materials or components to coincide with the production schedule of certain products and to ensure their availability at known unit prices.
We have a number of programs that are designated as classified by the U.S. Government, and that cannot be specifically described. The operating results of these classified programs are included in our consolidated and business segment results and are subject to the same oversight and internal controls as our other programs.
Our net sales are primarily derived from long-term contracts for products and services provided to the U.S. Government as well as FMS contracted through the U.S. Government. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied.
Many of our contracts span several years and include highly complex technical requirements. At the outset of a contract accounted for under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract, as well as our ability to earn variable consideration. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial
cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract and variable considerations. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. The profit booking rate may also be adjusted if the total estimated value of the contract changes or there is a contract modification. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. For further discussion on fixed-price contracts,
see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Changes in net sales and operating profit generally are expressed in terms of volume, contract mix, and/or performance (referred to as profit booking rate adjustments). Changes in volume refer to increases or decreases in sales or operating profit resulting from varying production activity levels, deliveries or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes in segment operating profit are typically based on the current profit booking rate for a particular contract. Contract mix primarily refers to changes in the ratio of contract type or life cycle (e.g., cost-type, fixed-price, development, production and/or sustainment) and other cost recoveries.
Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit booking rate adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit booking rate adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin can be impacted favorably or unfavorably by, for example, certain items listed below, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items include the adverse resolution of contractual matters, supply chain disruptions, restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets.
Our consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments decreased segment operating profit by approximately $180 million in 2024 and increased segment operating profit by $1.6 billion in 2023. The impact in 2024 includes losses of $555 million recognized on a classified program at our Aeronautics business segment, reach-forward losses of $1.4 billion recognized on a classified program at our MFC business segment and $155 million of favorable profit rate adjustments following the resolution of a long-standing claim associated with a completed C-5 Galaxy aircraft contract. The impact in 2023 included an unfavorable profit adjustment of $100 million on the Canadian Maritime Helicopte
r Program (CMHP)
and a $65 million favorable profit adjustment as a result of a positive resolution of a contractual matter on an international surveillance and control program at our RMS business segment. See the discussions under “Revenue Recognition” in “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.
Aeronautics
Our Aeronautics business segment is engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies. Aeronautics’ major programs include the F-35 Lightning II, C‑130 Hercules, F-16 Fighting Falcon and F-22 Raptor. Aeronautics’ operating results included the following (in millions):
Aeronautics’ net sales in 2024 increased $1.1 billion, or 4%, compared to 2023.
The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $1.0 billion on the F-35 program due to higher volume on sustainment, production and development contracts; and $210 million on the F-16 program due to the ramp up on production; partially offset by $200 million on
classified programs primarily driven by the sales impact of recognizing losses on one contract (s
ee “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies”)
, partially offset by higher volume across the classified programs portfolio.
Aeronautics’ operating profit in 2024 decreased $302 million, or 11%, compared to 2023.
The decrease in operating profit was attributable to $375 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments, partially offset by $120 million from higher volume and program ramp up described above. The decrease in profit booking rate adjustments was primarily due to $555 million of losses recognized on a classified contract (s
ee “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies”)
; partially offset by $155 million of favorable profit rate adjustments following the resolution of a long-standing claim associated with a completed C-5 Galaxy aircraft contract.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher orders on the F-35 program.
Missiles and Fire Control
Our MFC business segment provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; manned and unmanned ground vehicles; and energy management solutions. MFC’s major programs include PAC‑3, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD), Multiple Launch Rocket System (MLRS), Precision Strike Missile (PrSM), Joint Air-to-Surface Standoff Missile (JASSM), Long-Range Anti-Ship Missile (LRASM), Hellfire, Apache fire control system, Sniper Advanced Targeting Pod (SNIPER
®
), Infrared Search and Track (IRST21
®
), Special Operations Forces Global Logistics Support Services (SOF GLSS), hypersonics programs and Javelin. MFC’s operating results included the following (in millions):
MFC’s net sales in 2024 increased $1.4 billion, or 13%, compared to 2023.
The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $1.2 billion for tactical and strike missile programs due to production ramp up on GMLRS, LRASM and JASSM; and $145 million for integrated air and missile defense programs due to production ramp up on PAC-3.
MFC’s operating profit in 2024 decreased $1.1 billion, or 73%, compared to 2023.
The decrease in operating profit was attributable to $1.2 billion of lower profit booking rate adjustments, which includes $1.4 billion in losses on a classified program (s
ee “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies”)
, partially offset by the production ramp up described above.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher orders on PAC-3, JASSM and GMLRS programs.
Rotary and Mission Systems
RMS designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, surface ships, sea and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, laser systems, sea and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, and simulation and training solutions. RMS’ major programs include Aegis Combat System, Littoral Combat Ship (LCS), Multi-Mission Surface Combatant (MMSC), Canadian Surface Combatant (CSC), Black Hawk and Seahawk helicopters, CH-53K King Stallion heavy lift helicopter, Combat Rescue Helicopter (CRH), VH-92A helicopter, and the C2BMC program. RMS’ operating results included the following (in millions):
RMS’ net sales in 2024 increased $1.0 billion, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023.
The increase was primarily attributable to higher net sales of $750 million on IWSS programs due to higher volume on radar programs, the CSC program and new program ramp up within the laser systems portfolio; $175 million for various C6ISR programs due to higher volume; and $140 million for Sikorsky helicopter programs due to higher production volume on the CH-53K program, partially offset by lower volume on the VH-92A program.
RMS’ operating profit in 2024 increased $56 million, or 3%, compared to the same period in 2023.
The increase in operating profit was attributable to $115 million from higher volume described above and $85 million from favorable contract mix and cost recoveries, partially offset by $155 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments. The decrease in profit booking rate adjustments was due to unfavorable profit rate adjustments on the Seahawk production program, partially offset by the net impact in 2023 of both a $100 million unfavorable profit rate adjustment on CMHP and a $65 million favorable profit rate adjustment on an international surveillance and control program that did not recur in 2024.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher orders on IWSS and C6ISR programs.
Space
Our Space business segment is engaged in the research and design, development, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike and defensive systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze, and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Space’s major programs include the Trident II D5 Fleet Ballistic Missile (FBM), Orion Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle (Orion), Next Generation Overhead Persistent Infrared (Next Gen OPIR) system, Global Positioning System (GPS) III, hypersonics and transport layer programs and Next Generation Interceptor (NGI). Operating profit for our Space business segment includes our share of earnings for our investment in United Launch Alliance (ULA), which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Space’s operating results included the following (in millions):
Space’s net sales in 2024 decreased $126 million, or 1%, compared to the same period in 2023.
The decrease was primarily attributable to lower net sales of $320 million for national security space programs due to lower volume on classified programs and $145 million for commercial civil space due to lower volume on the Orion program, partially offset by higher volume on other space exploration programs. These decreases were partially offset by higher net sales of $255 million for strategic and missile defense programs due to higher volume on FBM and reentry programs.
Space’s operating profit in 2024 increased $68 million, or 6%, compared to the same period in 2023.
The increase was primarily attributable to $100 million related to favorable contract mix and cost recoveries across the portfolio, partially offset by $55 million of lower profit booking rate adjustments due to lower net favorable profit rate adjustments on the Orion program and $25 million of higher equity earnings driven by higher launch volume from our investment in ULA.
Equity earnings
Total equity earnings (attributable to our investment in ULA) represented approximately $45 million and $20 million, or 4% and 2%, of Space’s operating profit during 2024 and 2023.
Backlog
Backlog increased in 2024 compared to 2023 primarily due to higher orders for National Security Space for classified programs, Commercial Civil Space for GeoXO program, and Strategic and Missiles Defense for FBM Mk7 program.
Liquidity and Cash Flows
As of December 31, 2024, we had cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion that was generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory or other restrictions. Our principal source of liquidity is our cash from operations. However, we also have access to credit markets, if needed, for liquidity or general corporate purposes. This access includes our $3.0 billion revolving credit facility or the ability to issue commercial paper (see “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information). There were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility or commercial paper at year end for either 2024 or 2023.
Cash received from customers is our primary source of cash from operations. However, from time to time, we fund customer programs ourselves pending government appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on the contract or in advance of a contract award, this negatively affects our cash flows, and we may be at risk for reimbursement of the excess costs.
Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. We generally bill and collect cash more frequently under cost-reimbursable contracts, which represented approximately 40% of the sales we recorded in 2024, as we are authorized to bill as the costs are incurred. A number of our fixed-price contracts may provide for performance-based payments, which allow us to bill and collect cash as we perform on the contract. The amounts of performance-based payments and the related milestones are determined in the negotiation of each contract. The timing of such payments may differ from the timing of the costs incurred related to our contract performance, thereby affecting our cash flows.
The U.S. Government has indicated that it would consider progress payments as the baseline for negotiating payment terms on fixed-price contracts, rather than performance-based payments. In contrast to negotiated performance-based payment terms, progress payment provisions correspond to a percentage of the amount of costs incurred during the performance of the contract and are invoiced regularly as costs are incurred. Our cash flows may be affected if the U.S. Government changes its payment policies. The U.S. Government from time to time withholds payments on certain of our billings based on contract terms or regulatory provisions. Ultimately, the impact of policy changes or withholding payments may delay the receipt of cash, but the cumulative amount of cash collected during the life of the contract should not vary. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated payments to the supply chain with a focus on small and at-risk businesses. We will continue to evaluate the use of accelerated payments on an as needed basis.
We seek to maintain a disciplined and dynamic cash deployment strategy to invest in our business and key technologies to provide our customers with enhanced capabilities, enhance stockholder value, and position ourselves to take advantage of new business opportunities when they arise. Consistent with that strategy, we have continued to invest in our business and technologies through capital expenditures, independent research and development, and selective business acquisitions and investments.
We continue to return cash to stockholders through dividends and share repurchases. In October 2024, the Board of Directors authorized a fourth quarter dividend payment of $3.30 per share, representing an increase of $0.15 per share over the prior quarterly dividend payment. The Board of Directors also authorized an increase of $3.0 billion to our share repurchase program in October 2024. The remaining authorization under our program was $9.3 billion as of December 31, 2024. The stock repurchase program does not have an expiration date and may be amended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time. The amount of shares ultimately purchased and the timing of purchases are at the discretion of management and subject to compliance with applicable law and regulation.
We continue to actively manage our debt levels, including maturities and interest rates. We seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.
We also actively manage our pension obligations and expect to continue to opportunistically manage our pension liabilities through the purchase of group annuity contracts or other actions for portions of our outstanding defined benefit pension obligations using assets from the pension trust. See “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Future pension risk transfer transactions could be significant and result in us making additional contributions to the pension trust. The required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and CAS. We could be required to make pension contributions earlier than and/or in excess of what was planned if our return on pension assets is less than our assumptions, which would reduce our free cash flow. We may also make additional contributions at our discretion.
The following table provides a summary of our cash flow information followed by a discussion of the key elements (in millions):
Operating Activities
Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $948 million in 2024 compared to 2023. The decrease was primarily due to a pension contribution of $990 million. Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds, were $1.3 billion in 2024, compared to $1.8 billion in 2023.
Non-GAAP Financial Measure - Free Cash Flow
Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure that we define as cash from operations less capital expenditures. Our capital expenditures are comprised of equipment and facilities infrastructure and information technology (inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software that are capitalized). We use free cash flow to evaluate our business performance and overall liquidity, and is a performance goal in our annual and long-term incentive plans. We believe free cash flow is a useful measure for investors because it represents the amount of cash generated from operations after reinvesting in the business and that may be available to return to stockholders and creditors (through dividends, stock repurchases and debt repayments) or available to fund acquisitions and other investments. The entire amount of free cash flow is not necessarily available for discretionary expenditures, however, because it does not account for certain mandatory expenditures, such as the repayment of maturing debt and future pension contributions. While management believes that free cash flow as a non-GAAP financial measure may be useful in evaluating our financial performance, it should be considered supplemental to, and not a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.
The following table reconciles net cash provided by operating activities to free cash flow (in millions):
Free cash flow decreased $942 million compared to 2023 primarily due to the decrease in cash provided by operating activities described above, partially offset by lower capital expenditures.
Investing Activities
Cash flows related to investing activities primarily include capital expenditures and payments for acquisitions and divestitures of businesses and investments. The majority of our capital expenditures are for equipment and facilities infrastructure that generally are incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. We also
incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.
Net cash used for investing activities increased $98 million in 2024 compared to 2023, primarily due to a $231 million cash payment for the acquisition of Terran Orbital, partially offset by proceeds of $170 million from the sale of our Commercial Engine Solutions (CES) business.
Financing Activities
Net cash used for financing activities decreased $3.2 billion in 2024 compared to 2023.
We paid dividends totaling $3.1 billion ($12.75 per share) in 2024 and $3.1 billion ($12.15 per share) in 2023. We paid quarterly dividends of $3.15 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2024 and $3.30 per share during the fourth quarter of 2024; $3.00 per share during each of the first three quarters of 2023 and $3.15 per share during the fourth quarter of 2023.
During 2024, we paid $3.7 billion to repurchase 7.5 million shares of our common stock. See “Note 12 – Stockholders’ Equity” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. During 2023, we paid $6.0 billion to repurchase 13.4 million shares of our common stock.
During 2024, we received net proceeds of $3.0 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes. See “Note 10 – Debt” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Additionally, we repaid $168 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 8.375% according to their scheduled maturities.
During 2023, we received net proceeds of $2.0 billion from issuance of senior unsecured notes and repaid $115 million of long-term notes with a fixed interest rate of 7.00% according to their scheduled maturities.
Capital Structure, Resources and Other
At December 31, 2024, we held cash and cash equivalents of $2.5 billion that were generally available to fund ordinary business operations without significant legal, regulatory, or other restrictions.
Our total outstanding short-term and long-term debt, net of unamortized discounts and issuance costs, was $20.3 billion as of December 31, 2024 and is in the form of publicly issued notes that bear interest at fixed rates. As of December 31, 2024, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our debt and credit agreements.
See “
Note 10 – Debt
”
included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our long-term debt and revolving credit facilities.
We actively seek to finance our business in a manner that preserves financial flexibility while minimizing borrowing costs to the extent practicable. We review changes in financial market and economic conditions to manage the types, amounts and maturities of our indebtedness. We may at times refinance existing indebtedness, vary our mix of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt or seek alternative financing sources for our cash and operational needs.
Contractual Commitments
At December 31, 2024, we had contractual commitments to repay debt, make payments under operating leases, settle obligations related to agreements to purchase goods and services and settle tax and other liabilities. Financing lease obligations were not material. Payments due under these obligations and commitments are as follows (in millions):
The table above includes debt presented gross of any unamortized discounts and issuance costs, but excludes the net unfunded obligation and estimated minimum funding requirements related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans. For additional information about obligations and our future minimum contribution requirements for these plans, see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts related to other liabilities represent the contractual obligations for certain long-term liabilities recorded as of December 31, 2024. Such amounts mainly include expected payments under non-qualified pension plans, environmental liabilities and deferred compensation plans.
Purchase obligations related to operating activities include agreements and contracts that give the supplier recourse to us for cancellation or nonperformance under the contract or contain terms that would subject us to liquidated damages. Such agreements and contracts may, for example, be related to direct materials, obligations to subcontractors and outsourcing arrangements. Total purchase obligations for operating activities in the preceding table include approximately $64.3 billion related to contractual commitments entered into as a result of contracts we have with our U.S. Government customers. The U.S. Government generally would be required to pay us for any costs we incur relative to these commitments if they were to terminate the related contracts “for convenience” under the FAR, subject to available funding. This also would be true in cases where we perform subcontract work for a prime contractor under a U.S. Government contract. The termination for convenience language also may be included in contracts with foreign, state and local governments. We also have contracts with customers that do not include termination for convenience provisions, including contracts with commercial customers.
The majority of our capital expenditures for 2024 and those planned for 2025 are for equipment, facilities infrastructure and information technology. The amounts above in the table represent the portion of expected capital expenditures to be incurred in 2025 and beyond that have been obligated under contracts as of December 31, 2024 and not necessarily total capital expenditures for future periods. Expenditures for equipment and facilities infrastructure are generally incurred to support new and existing programs across all of our business segments. For example, we have projects underway at Aeronautics to support classified development programs and at RMS to support our Sikorsky helicopter programs; and we have projects underway to modernize certain of our facilities. We also incur capital expenditures for information technology to support programs and general enterprise information technology infrastructure, inclusive of costs for the development or purchase of internal-use software.
We also may enter into industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset agreements, as a condition to obtaining orders for our products and services from certain customers in foreign countries. These agreements are designed to enhance the social and economic environment of the foreign country by requiring the contractor to promote investment in the country. Offset agreements may be satisfied through activities that do not require us to use cash, including transferring technology, providing manufacturing and other consulting support to in-country projects and the purchase by third parties (e.g.
,
our vendors) of supplies from in-country vendors. These agreements also may be satisfied through our use of cash for such activities as purchasing supplies from in-country vendors, providing financial support for in-country projects, establishment of joint ventures with local companies and building or leasing facilities for in-country operations. We typically do not commit to offset agreements until orders for our products or services are definitive. The amounts ultimately applied against our offset agreements are based on negotiations with the customer and typically require cash outlays that represent only a fraction of the original amount in the offset agreement. Satisfaction of our offset obligations are included in the estimates of our total costs to complete the contract and may impact our sales, profitability and cash flows. Our ability to recover investments on our consolidated balance sheet that we make to satisfy offset obligations is generally dependent upon the successful operation of
ventures that we do not control and may involve products and services that are dissimilar to our business activities. At December 31, 2024, the notional value of remaining obligations under our outstanding offset agreements totaled approximately $19.1 billion, which primarily relate to our Aeronautics, MFC and RMS business segments, most of which extend through 2044. To the extent we have entered into purchase or other obligations at December 31, 2024 that also satisfy offset agreements, those amounts are included in the contractual commitments table above. Offset programs usually extend over several years and may provide for penalties, estimated at approximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2024, in the event we fail to perform in accordance with offset requirements. While historically we have not been required to pay material penalties, resolution of offset requirements are often the result of negotiations and subjective judgments.
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. In some cases, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2024, we had the following outstanding letters of credit, surety bonds and third-party guarantees (in millions):
(a)
Approximately $708 million of standby letters of credit in the “Less Than 1 Year” category are expected to renew for additional periods until completion of the contractual obligation.
At December 31, 2024, third-party guarantees totaled $351 million, of which approximately 30% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner.
In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements, all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.
Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates
Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with U.S. GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. We employ judgment in making our estimates in consideration of historical experience, currently available information and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe the following accounting policies are critical to the understanding of our consolidated financial statements and require the use of significant management judgment in their application. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Contract Accounting / Sales Recognition
The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including FMS contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For performance obligations in which control transfers continuously to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage of completion cost-to-cost measure of progress.
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. We also estimate variable
consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. All of the estimates require significant judgement and are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident, which we refer to as a reach-forward loss.
Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts. Segment operating profit and margin may also be impacted favorably or unfavorably by other items, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items may include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items may include the adverse resolution of contractual matters, supply chain disruptions, restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets.
For the impacts of changes in estimates and assumptions on our consolidated financial statements, see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Other Contract Accounting Considerations
The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. Government. Cost-based pricing is determined under the FAR. The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. Government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, interest expense and certain advertising and public relations activities are unallowable and, therefore, not recoverable through sales. In addition, we may enter into advance agreements with the U.S. Government that address the subjects of allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. For example, most of the environmental costs we incur for environmental remediation related to sites operated in prior years are allocated to our current operations as general and administrative costs under FAR provisions and supporting advance agreements reached with the U.S. Government.
We closely monitor compliance with and the consistent application of our critical accounting policies related to contract accounting. Costs incurred and allocated to contracts are reviewed for compliance with U.S. Government regulations by our personnel and are subject to audit by the Defense Contract Audit Agency.
Postretirement Benefit Plans
Overview
Many of our employees and retirees participate in qualified and nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans - see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). The majority of our accrued benefit obligations relate to our qualified defined benefit pension and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the net funded status of these postretirement benefit plans under GAAP as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status represents the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The GAAP benefit obligation represents the present value of the estimated future benefits we currently expect to pay to plan participants based on past service. The qualified defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees are fully frozen effective January 1, 2020 and our salaried employees participate in a defined contribution retirement savings plan.
We continue to take actions to reduce the size of our defined benefit pension plans. From December 2018, through our master retirement trust, we have transferred outstanding defined benefit pension obligations to third party insurance companies; reducing annually required Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC) premiums. We expect to continue to look for opportunities to manage our pension liabilities through additional pension risk transfer transactions in future years. Future transactions could result in a noncash settlement charge to earnings, which could be material to a reporting period.
Notwithstanding these actions, the impact of our postretirement benefit plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record and the funded status for our postretirement benefit plans may materially change from year to year because the calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including interest rates, actual rates of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity, as well as the timing of cash funding.
Actuarial Assumptions
The benefit obligations and assets of our postretirement benefit plans are measured at the end of each year, or more frequently, upon the occurrence of certain events such as a significant plan amendment (including in connection with a pension risk transfer transaction), settlement, or curtailment. The amounts we record are measured using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon key assumptions such as discount rates, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and participant longevity. The assumptions we make affect both the calculation of the benefit obligations as of the measurement date and the calculation of FAS expense in subsequent periods. When reassessing these assumptions, we consider past and current market conditions and make judgments about future market trends. We also consider factors such as the timing and amounts of expected contributions to the plans and benefit payments to plan participants.
We continue to use a single weighted average discount rate approach when calculating our consolidated benefit obligations related to our defined benefit pension plans resulting in 5.625% at December 31, 2024, compared to 5.00% at December 31, 2023. We utilized a single weighted average discount rate of 5.50% when calculating our benefit obligations related to our retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31, 2024, compared to 5.00% at December 31, 2023. We evaluate several data points in order to arrive at an appropriate single weighted average discount rate, including results from cash flow models, quoted rates from long-term bond indices and changes in long-term bond rates over the past year. As part of our evaluation, we calculate the approximate average yields on corporate bonds rated AA or better selected to match our projected postretirement benefit plan cash flows. The increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2023 to December 31, 2024 resulted in a decrease in the projected benefit obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans of approximately $1.8 billion at December 31, 2024.
We utilized an expected long-term rate of return on plan assets of 6.50% at both December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of return on the funds invested or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. This assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The difference between the expected and actual return affects both the funded status of our benefit plans and the calculation of FAS pension expense in subsequent periods. Although the actual return in any specific year likely will differ from the assumption, the average expected return over a long-term future horizon should be approximately equal to the assumption. Any variance in a particular year should not, by itself, suggest that the assumption should be changed. Patterns of variances are reviewed over time, and then combined with expectations for the future. As a result, changes in this assumption are less frequent than changes in the discount rate. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2024 was approximately 1%. This resulted in an actual investment return on the plan assets during year 2024 of $288 million, versus the expected $1.6 billion based on our 6.50% long-term rate of return assumption.
Our stockholders’ equity has been reduced cumulatively by $8.3 billion from the annual year-end measurements of the funded status of postretirement benefit plans. The cumulative noncash, after-tax reduction primarily represents net actuarial losses resulting from changes in discount rates, investment experience, and updated longevity. A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three-year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These cumulative actuarial losses will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations, over an average period of approximately twenty years as of December 31, 2024. During 2024, $76 million of these amounts, inclusive of amortization of net prior service credit, were recognized as a component of postretirement benefit plan expense.
The discount rate and long-term rate of return on plan assets assumptions we select at the end of each year are based on our best estimates and judgment. A change of plus or minus 25 basis points in the 5.625% discount rate assumption at December 31, 2024, with all other assumptions held constant, would have decreased or increased the amount of the qualified pension benefit obligation we recorded at the end of 2024 by approximately $725 million, which would result in an after-tax increase or decrease in stockholders’ equity at the end of the year of approximately $575 million. If the 5.625% discount rate at December 31, 2024 that was used to compute the expected 2025 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2025 would be lower or higher by approximately $5 million. If the 6.50% expected long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption at December 31, 2024 that was used to compute the expected 2025 FAS pension expense for our qualified defined benefit pension plans had been 25 basis points higher or lower, with all other assumptions held constant, the amount of FAS pension expense projected for 2025 would be lower or higher by approximately $55 million. Each year, differences between the actual and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets impacts the measurement of the following year’s FAS pension expense. Every 100 basis points increase (decrease) in return during 2024 between our actual rate of return
of approximately 1% and our expected long-term rate of return decreased (increased) expected 2025 FAS pension expense by approximately $10 million.
Funding Considerations
We made cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans of $990 million in 2024, and no contributions in 2023. Funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. The funded status under ERISA is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP. Our goal has been to fund each of our qualified defined benefit pension plans to a level of at least 80% as determined in accordance with ERISA; which may require the use of different assumptions, such as the discount rate and longevity, than used under GAAP. All of our qualified defined benefit pension plans had an ERISA funded status of at least 80% as of both December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Contributions to our defined benefit pension plans are recovered over time through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts, including FMS, and are recognized in our cost of sales and net sales. CAS rules govern the extent to which our pension costs are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS. Pension cost recoveries under CAS occur in different periods from when pension contributions are made in accordance with ERISA.
We recovered $1.7 billion in both 2024 and 2023 as CAS pension costs. Amounts contributed in excess of the CAS pension costs recovered under U.S. Government contracts are considered to be prepayment credits under the CAS rules. Our prepayment credits were approximately $2.2 billion and $2.9 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The prepayment credit balance will increase or decrease based on our actual investment return on plan assets.
Environmental Matters
We are a party to various agreements, proceedings and potential proceedings for environmental remediation issues, including matters at various sites where we have been designated a potentially responsible party (PRP). We also are involved in environmental remediation activities at sites where formal agreements either do not exist or do not quantify the extent and timing of our obligations. Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating the costs more judgmental due to, for example, changing remediation technologies. To determine the costs related to clean up sites, we have to assess the extent of contamination, effects on natural resources, the appropriate technology to be used to accomplish the remediation and evolving environmental standards.
We perform quarterly reviews of environmental remediation sites and record liabilities and receivables in the period it becomes probable that the liabilities have been incurred and the amounts can be reasonably estimated (see the discussion under “Environmental Matters” in “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” and “Note 14 – Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). We consider the above factors in our quarterly estimates of the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for environmental remediation activities, which result in the calculation of a range of estimates for each particular environmental remediation site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Given the required level of judgment and estimation, it is likely that materially different amounts could be recorded if different assumptions were used or if circumstances were to change (e.g.
,
a change in environmental standards or a change in our estimate of the extent of contamination).
Under agreements reached with the U.S. Government, most of the amounts we spend for environmental remediation are allocated to our operations as general and administrative costs. Under existing U.S. Government regulations, these and other environmental expenditures relating to our U.S. Government business, after deducting any recoveries received from insurance or other PRPs, are allowable in establishing prices of our products and services. As a result, most of the expenditures we incur are included in our net sales and cost of sales according to U.S. Government agreement or regulation, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement.
As disclosed above, we may record changes in the amount of environmental remediation liabilities as a result of our quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites, which would result in a change to the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery and a charge to earnings. For example, if we were to determine that the liabilities should be increased by $100 million, the corresponding amount that is probable of future recovery would be increased by
approximately $89 million, with the remainder recorded as a charge to earnings. This allocation is determined annually, based upon our existing and projected business activities with the U.S. Government.
We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure at all environmental remediation sites with which we are involved. There are a number of former operating facilities we are monitoring or investigating for potential future environmental remediation. In some cases, although a loss may be probable, it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the amount of any obligation for remediation activities because of uncertainties (e.g., assessing the extent of the contamination). During any particular quarter, such uncertainties may be resolved, allowing us to estimate and recognize the initial liability to remediate a particular former operating site. The amount of the liability could be material. Upon recognition of the liability, a portion will be recognized as a receivable with the remainder charged to earnings, which may have a material effect in any particular interim reporting period.
If we are ultimately found to have liability at those sites where we have been designated a PRP, we expect that the actual costs of environmental remediation will be shared with other liable PRPs. Generally, PRPs that are ultimately determined to be responsible parties are strictly liable for site remediation and usually agree among themselves to share, on an allocated basis, the costs and expenses for environmental investigation and remediation. Under existing environmental laws, responsible parties are jointly and severally liable and, therefore, we are potentially liable for the full cost of funding such remediation. In the unlikely event that we were required to fund the entire cost of such remediation, the statutory framework provides that we may pursue rights of cost recovery or contribution from the other PRPs. The amounts we record do not reflect the fact that we may recover some of the environmental costs we have incurred through insurance or from other PRPs, which we are required to pursue by agreement and U.S. Government regulation.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
The assets and liabilities of acquired businesses are recorded under the acquisition method of accounting at their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets from acquired businesses are recognized at fair value on the acquisition date and consist of customer programs, trademarks, customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets. Customer programs includes values assigned to major programs of acquired businesses and represents the aggregate value associated with the customer relationships, contracts, technology and trademarks underlying the associated program. Intangible assets are amortized over a period of expected cash flows used to measure fair value, which typically ranges from three to 20 years.
Our goodwill balance was $11.1 billion and $10.8 billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. Such events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration in overall economic conditions, changes in the business climate of our industry, a decline in our market capitalization, operating performance indicators, competition, reorganizations of our business, U.S. Government budget restrictions or the disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit. Our goodwill has been allocated to and is tested for impairment at a level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or a level below the business segment. The level at which we test goodwill for impairment requires us to determine whether the operations below the business segment constitute a self-sustaining business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results.
We may use both qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
To perform the quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgments, including the amount and timing of expected future cash flows, long-term growth rates, discount rates and relevant comparable public company earnings multiples and relevant transaction multiples. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are based on our best estimate of future sales, earnings and cash flows after considering factors such as general market conditions, U.S. Government budgets, existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements, changes in
working capital, long term business plans and recent operating performance. The discount rates utilized in the DCF analysis are based on the respective reporting unit’s weighted average cost of capital, which takes into account the relative weights of each component of capital structure (equity and debt) and represents the expected cost of new capital, adjusted as appropriate to consider the risk inherent in future cash flows of the respective reporting unit. The carrying value of each reporting unit includes the assets and liabilities employed in its operations, goodwill and allocations of amounts held at the business segment and corporate levels.
Impairment assessments inherently involve management judgments regarding a number of assumptions such as those described above. Due to the many variables inherent in the estimation of a reporting unit’s fair value and the relative size of our recorded goodwill, differences in assumptions could have a material effect on the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. Additionally, acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. This testing compares carrying value to fair value and, when appropriate, the carrying value of these assets is reduced to fair value. In the fourth quarter of 2024, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test for each of our reporting units, and the results of those tests indicated no impairment existed.
Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their applicable useful lives, ranging from three to 20 years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired. If events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of a finite-lived intangible may be impaired, the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset group would be compared to the asset group’s carrying value. If the asset group’s carrying amount exceeded the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows, we would determine the fair value of the asset group and record an impairment loss in net earnings.

ITEM 7A.
Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk
We maintain active relationships with a broad and diverse group of U.S. and international financial institutions. We believe that they provide us with sufficient access to the general and trade credit we require to conduct our business. We closely monitor the financial market environment and actively manage counterparty exposure to minimize the potential impact from adverse developments with any single credit provider while ensuring availability of, and access to, sufficient credit resources.
Our main exposures to market risk relate to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and market prices on certain equity securities. Our financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk principally include fixed-rate long-term debt and commercial paper, if issued. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $20.2 billion at December 31, 2024 and the outstanding principal amount of debt, including short-term and long-term debt, was $21.6 billion, excluding unamortized discounts and issuance costs of $1.3 billion. A 10% change in the level of interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of our outstanding debt at December 31, 2024.
We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to minimize certain economic exposures.
The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $1.3 billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $7.5 billion and $6.5 billion. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the net fair value of our derivative instruments was not material (see “Note 15 – Fair Value Measurements” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements). A 10% unfavorable exchange rate movement of our foreign currency contracts would not have a material impact on the aggregate net fair value of such contracts or our consolidated financial statements. Additionally, as we enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge foreign currency exposure on underlying transactions, we believe that any movement on our foreign currency contracts would be offset by movement on the underlying transactions and, therefore, when taken together do not create material risk.
We evaluate the credit quality of potential counterparties to derivative transactions and only enter into agreements with those deemed to have acceptable credit risk at the time the agreements are executed. Our foreign currency exchange hedge portfolio is diversified across many banks. We regularly monitor changes to counterparty credit quality as well as our concentration of credit exposure to individual counterparties. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
We maintain a separate trust that includes investments to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plans. As of December 31, 2024, investments in the trust totaled $1.8 billion and are reflected at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet in other noncurrent assets. The trust holds investments in marketable equity securities and fixed-income securities that are exposed to price changes and changes in interest rates. A portion of the liabilities associated with the deferred compensation plans supported by the trust is also impacted by changes in the market price of our common stock and certain market indices. Changes in the value of the liabilities have the effect of partially offsetting the impact of changes in the value of the trust. Both the change in the fair value of the trust and the change in the value of the liabilities are recognized on our consolidated statements of earnings in other unallocated, net and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2024.

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation at December 31, 2024 and 2023, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
These financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Critical Audit Matters
The critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements
Note 1 –
Organization and Significant Accounting Policies
Organization
– We are a global aerospace and defense company principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We also provide a broad range of management, engineering, technical, scientific, logistics, system integration and cybersecurity services. We serve both U.S. and international customers with products and services that have defense, civil and commercial applications, with our principal customers being agencies of the U.S. Government. As described in “Note 3 – Information on Business Segments”, we operate in
four
business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space.
Basis of presentation
– These consolidated financial statements include the accounts of subsidiaries we control and variable interest entities if we are the primary beneficiary. We eliminate intercompany balances and transactions in consolidation. We classify certain assets and liabilities as current utilizing the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year. This primarily impacts receivables, contract assets, inventories, and contract liabilities. We classify all other assets and liabilities based on whether the asset will be realized or the liability will be paid within one year. Additionally, certain prior year amounts in the consolidated statements of cash flows have been reclassified within operating activities to conform to the current year’s presentation. These reclassifications were not material and had no impact on total net cash provided by operating activities as previously reported.
On October 30, 2024, we closed our acquisition of Terran Orbital Corporation (Terran Orbital) for a purchase consideration of $
million. We accounted for this acquisition as a “step acquisition” (as defined in U.S. GAAP) and accordingly, $
million of our previously held investments in Terran Orbital were included as part of the purchase consideration. The remaining purchase price of $
million was paid with cash on hand (net of cash acquired). Terran Orbital became a wholly-owned subsidiary and operates within our Space business segment. The purchase consideration of $
million was allocated to the estimated fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired, with any excess purchase price recorded as goodwill. As a result, we recorded goodwill of $
million at our Space business segment. The final determination of the fair values of certain assets and liabilities will be completed within the measurement period of up to one year from the respective acquisition date. The financial results of Terran Orbital have been included within our operating results in the period post-acquisition.
Use of estimates
– We prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). In doing so, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ materially from these estimates. Significant estimates inherent in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements include, but are not limited to, accounting for sales and cost recognition; postretirement benefit plans; environmental liabilities and assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery; evaluation of goodwill, intangible assets, investments and other assets for impairment; income taxes including deferred income taxes; fair value measurements; and contingencies.
Revenue Recognition
–
The majority of our net sales are generated from long-term contracts with the U.S. Government and international customers (including foreign military sales (FMS) contracted through the U.S. Government) for the research, design, development, manufacture, integration and sustainment of advanced technology systems, products and services. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable. For certain contracts that meet the foregoing requirements, primarily international direct commercial sale contracts, we are required to obtain certain regulatory approvals. In these cases, we recognize revenue when it is probable that we will receive regulatory approvals based upon all known facts and circumstances. We provide our products and services under fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts.
Under fixed-price contracts, we agree to perform the specified work for a pre-determined price. To the extent our actual costs vary from the estimates upon which the price was negotiated, we will generate more or less profit or could incur a loss. Some fixed-price contracts have a performance-based component under which we may earn incentive payments or incur financial penalties based on our performance.
Cost-reimbursable contracts provide for the payment of allowable costs incurred during performance of the contract plus a fee up to a ceiling based on the amount that has been funded. Typically, we enter into
three
types of cost-reimbursable contracts: cost-plus-award-fee, cost-plus-incentive-fee, and cost-plus-fixed-fee. Cost-plus-award-fee contracts provide for an
award fee that varies within specified limits based on the customer’s assessment of our performance against a predetermined set of criteria, such as targets based on cost, quality, technical and schedule criteria. Cost-plus-incentive-fee contracts provide for reimbursement of costs plus a fee, which is adjusted by a formula based on the relationship of total allowable costs to total target costs (i.e., incentive based on cost) or reimbursement of costs plus an incentive to exceed stated performance targets (i.e., incentive based on performance). Cost-plus-fixed-fee contracts provide a fixed fee that is negotiated at the inception of the contract and does not vary with actual costs.
We assess each contract at its inception to determine whether it should be combined with other contracts. When making this determination, we consider factors such as whether two or more contracts were negotiated and executed at or near the same time or were negotiated with an overall profit objective. If combined, we treat the combined contracts as a single contract for revenue recognition purposes.
We evaluate the products or services promised in each contract at inception to determine whether the contract should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations. The products and services in our contracts are typically not distinct from one another due to their complex relationships and the significant contract management functions required to perform under the contract. Accordingly, our contracts are typically accounted for as one performance obligation. In limited cases, our contracts have more than one distinct performance obligation, which occurs when we perform activities that are not highly complex or interrelated or involve different product lifecycles. Significant judgment is required in determining performance obligations, and these decisions could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. We classify net sales as products or services on our consolidated statements of earnings based on the predominant attributes of the performance obligations.
We determine the transaction price for each contract based on the consideration we expect to receive for the products or services being provided under the contract. For contracts where a portion of the price may vary (e.g., awards, incentive fees and claims), we estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount, which is included in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We analyze the risk of a significant revenue reversal and if necessary constrain the amount of variable consideration recognized in order to mitigate this risk.
At the inception of a contract, we estimate the transaction price based on our current rights and do not contemplate future modifications (including unexercised options) or follow-on contracts until they become legally enforceable. Contracts are often subsequently modified to include changes in specifications, requirements or price, which may create new or change existing enforceable rights and obligations. Depending on the nature of the modification, we consider whether to account for the modification as an adjustment to the existing contract or as a separate contract. Generally, modifications to our contracts are not distinct from the existing contract due to the significant integration and interrelated tasks provided in the context of the contract. Therefore, such modifications are accounted for as if they were part of the existing contract and recognized as a cumulative adjustment to revenue.
For contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated standalone selling price of the product or service underlying each performance obligation. The standalone selling price represents the amount we would sell the product or service to a customer on a standalone basis (i.e., not bundled with any other products or services). Our contracts with the U.S. Government, including FMS contracts, are subject to the FAR and the price is typically based on estimated or actual costs plus a reasonable profit margin. As a result of these regulations, the standalone selling price of products or services in our contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts are typically equal to the selling price stated in the contract.
For non-U.S. government contracts with multiple performance obligations, we evaluate whether the stated selling prices for the products or services represent their standalone selling prices. We primarily sell customized solutions unique to a customer’s specifications. When it is necessary to allocate the transaction price to multiple performance obligations, we typically use the expected cost plus a reasonable profit margin to estimate the standalone selling price of each product or service. We occasionally sell standard products or services with observable standalone sales transactions. In these situations, the observable standalone sales transactions are used to determine the standalone selling price.
We recognize revenue as performance obligations are satisfied and the customer obtains control of the products and services. In determining when performance obligations are satisfied, we consider factors such as contract terms, payment terms and whether there is an alternative future use of the product or service. Substantially all of our revenue is recognized over time as we perform under the contract because control of the work in process transfers continuously to the customer. For most contracts with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, this continuous transfer of control of the work in process to the customer is supported by clauses in the contract that give the customer ownership of work in process and allow the customer to unilaterally terminate the contract for convenience and pay us for costs incurred plus a reasonable profit. For most non-U.S. government contracts, primarily international direct commercial contracts, continuous transfer of control to our customer is
supported because we deliver products that do not have an alternative use to us and if our customer were to terminate the contract for reasons other than our non-performance we would have the right to recover damages which would include, among other potential damages, the right to payment for our work performed to date plus a reasonable profit.
For performance obligations to deliver products with continuous transfer of control to the customer, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation, generally using the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress for our contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the performance obligation(s). For performance obligations to provide services to the customer, revenue is recognized over time based on costs incurred or the right to invoice method (in situations where the value transferred matches our billing rights) as our customer receives and consumes the benefits.
For performance obligations in which control does not continuously transfer to the customer, we recognize revenue at the point in time in which each performance obligation is fully satisfied. This coincides with the point in time the customer obtains control of the product or service, which typically occurs upon customer acceptance or receipt of the product or service, given that we maintain control of the product or service until that point.
Backlog (i.e., unfulfilled or remaining performance obligations) represents the sales we expect to recognize for our products and services for which control has not yet transferred to the customer. It is converted into sales in future periods as work is performed or deliveries are made. For our cost-reimbursable and fixed-priced-incentive contracts, the estimated consideration we expect to receive pursuant to the terms of the contract may exceed the contractual award amount. The estimated consideration is determined at the outset of the contract and is continuously reviewed throughout the contract period. In determining the estimated consideration, we consider the risks related to the technical, schedule and cost impacts to complete the contract and an estimate of any variable consideration. Periodically, we review these risks and may increase or decrease backlog accordingly. As the risks on such contracts are successfully retired, the estimated consideration from customers may be reduced, resulting in a reduction of backlog without a corresponding recognition of sales.
As of December 31, 2024, our ending backlog was $
176.0
billion. We expect to recognize approximately
% of our backlog over the next
months and approximately
% over the next
months as revenue, with the remainder recognized thereafter.
For arrangements with the U.S. Government and FMS contracts, we generally do not begin work on contracts until funding is appropriated by the customer. Billing timetables and payment terms on our contracts vary based on a number of factors, including the contract type. Typical payment terms under fixed-price contracts with the U.S. Government provide that the customer pays either performance-based payments (PBPs) based on the achievement of contract milestones or progress payments based on a percentage of costs we incur. Typical payment terms under cost-reimbursable contracts with the U.S Government provide for billing of allowable costs incurred plus applicable fee on a monthly or semi-monthly basis. For the majority of our international direct commercial contracts to deliver complex systems, we typically receive advance payments prior to commencement of work, as well as milestone payments that are paid in accordance with the terms of our contract as we perform. We recognize a liability for payments in excess of revenue recognized, which is presented as a contract liability on the balance sheet. The portion of payments retained by the customer until final contract settlement is not considered a significant financing component because the intent is to protect the customer from our failure to adequately complete some or all of the obligations under the contract. Payments received from customers in advance of revenue recognition are not considered to be significant financing components because they are used to meet working capital demands that can be higher in the early stages of a contract.
For fixed-price and cost-reimbursable contracts, we present revenues recognized in excess of billings as contract assets on the balance sheet. Amounts billed and due from our customers under both contract types are classified as receivables on the balance sheet.
Significant estimates and assumptions are made in estimating contract sales, costs, and profit. We estimate profit as the difference between estimated revenues and total estimated costs to complete the contract. At the outset of a long-term contract, we identify and monitor risks to the achievement of the technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, as well as our ability to earn variable consideration, and assess the effects of those risks on our estimates of sales and total costs to complete the contract. The estimates consider the technical requirements (e.g., a newly developed product versus a mature product), the schedule and associated tasks (e.g., the number and type of milestone events) and costs (e.g., material, labor, subcontractor, overhead, general and administrative and the estimated costs to fulfill our industrial cooperation agreements, sometimes referred to as offset or localization agreements, required under certain contracts with international customers). The initial profit booking rate of each contract considers risks surrounding the ability to achieve the technical requirements, schedule and costs in the initial estimated total costs to complete the contract. Profit booking rates may increase during the performance of the contract if we successfully retire risks related to technical, schedule and cost aspects of the contract, which decreases the
estimated total costs to complete the contract or may increase the variable consideration we expect to receive on the contract. Conversely, our profit booking rates may decrease if the estimated total costs to complete the contract increase or our estimates of variable consideration we expect to receive decrease. All of the estimates are subject to change during the performance of the contract and may affect the profit booking rate. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of the transaction price, a provision for the entire loss is determined at the contract level and is recorded in the period in which the loss is evident, which we refer to as a reach-forward loss.
Comparability of our segment sales, operating profit and operating margin may be impacted favorably or unfavorably by changes in profit booking rates on our contracts. Increases in the profit booking rates, typically referred to as favorable profit booking rate adjustments, usually relate to revisions in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations that reflect improved conditions on a particular contract. Conversely, conditions on a particular contract may deteriorate, resulting in an increase in the estimated total costs to fulfill the performance obligations and a reduction in the profit booking rate and are typically referred to as unfavorable profit booking rate adjustments. Increases or decreases in profit booking rates are recognized in the period they are determined and reflect the inception-to-date effect of such changes. Segment operating profit and margin can be impacted favorably or unfavorably by, for example, certain items listed below, which may or may not impact sales. Favorable items include the positive resolution of contractual matters, cost recoveries on severance and restructuring, insurance recoveries and gains on sales of assets. Unfavorable items include the adverse resolution of contractual matters, supply chain disruptions, restructuring charges (except for significant severance actions, which are excluded from segment operating results), reserves for disputes, certain asset impairments, and losses on sales of certain assets.
Our consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments increased net sales by $
1.2
billion in 2024, $
1.6
billion in 2023, and $
2.0
billion in 2022. These adjustments decreased segment operating profit by approximately $
million ($
million, or $
0.59
per share, after-tax) in 2024 and increased segment operating profit by approximately $
1.6
billion ($
1.3
billion, or $
4.98
per share, after-tax) in 2023 and $
1.8
billion ($
1.4
billion, or $
5.40
per share, after-tax) in 2022. Consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2024 include losses of $
million on a classified program at our Aeronautics business segment, reach-forward losses of $
1.4
billion recognized on a classified program at our MFC business segment described below and $
million of favorable profit rate adjustments following the resolution of a long-standing claim associated with a completed C-5 Galaxy aircraft contract at our Aeronautics business segment. Consolidated net profit booking rate adjustments during the year ended December 31, 2023 include a favorable profit adjustment of $
million on an international surveillance and control program due to the positive resolution of a contractual matter at our RMS business segment, and a reach-forward loss of $
million on the Canadian Maritime Helicopter Program (CMHP) as a result of increased costs and lower than planned revenues at our RMS business segment described below.
We have various development programs for new and upgraded products, services, and related technologies which have complex design and technical challenges. This development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work by us and our suppliers. Many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements (e.g., cost-reimbursable or cost-plus-fee). In such cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates, or program cancellation if cost, schedule, or technical performance issues arise.
However, some of our existing development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis or include cost-type contracting for the development phase with fixed-price production options and our customers continue to implement procurement strategies such as these that shift risk to contractors. Competitively bid programs with fixed-price development work or fixed-price production options increase the risk of a reach-forward loss upon contract award and during the period of contract performance. Due to the complex and often experimental nature of development programs, we may experience (and have experienced in the past) technical and quality issues during the development of new products or technologies for a variety of reasons. Our development programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs and fixed-price contract structure creates financial risk as estimated completion costs may exceed the current contract value, which could trigger earnings charges, termination provisions, or other financially significant exposures. These programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues, and such losses could be significant to our financial condition and operating results in any period that they are recognized. Any such losses are recognized in the period in which the loss is evident.
We have experienced performance issues on an existing classified program at our Aeronautics business segment. The initial phase is on a fixed-price incentive fee contract with options for additional phases. Phases within the program involve highly complex design and systems integration and we have periodically recognized reach-forward losses. During 2024, we recognized $
million of losses on this program, including $
million recognized in the fourth quarter of 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we again performed a comprehensive review of the program requirements, technical complexities, schedule, risks, and risk mitigation actions as a result of performance trends experienced in 2024 and in contemplation of near-
term program milestones. Based on that review, we identified higher projected costs in engineering and integration activities that are necessary to achieve those forthcoming milestones. As of December 31, 2024, cumulative losses recognized to date on this program were approximately $
million. We will continue to proactively manage the technical requirements and our performance, the remaining work and any future changes in scope or schedule, and estimated costs to complete the program, including future phases, and we may have to record additional losses that become evident in future periods if we experience further performance issues, increases in scope, or cost growth, which could be material to our financial results. We and our industry team will continue to incur advanced procurement costs (also referred to as pre-contract costs) to enhance our ability to achieve the schedule and certain milestones. We will monitor the recoverability of pre-contract costs, which could be impacted by our assessment of the customer’s decision regarding the funding of future phases of the program.
We have contracted with the Canadian government for the CMHP at our RMS business segment that provides for design, development, and production of CH-148 aircraft (the Original Equipment contract), which is a military variant of the S-92 helicopter, and for logistical support to the fleet (the In Service Support contract) over an extended time period. The last of the 28 CH-148 aircraft is scheduled to be delivered in 2025. The program has experienced performance issues, including delays in the final aircraft deliveries from the original contract requirement, and the Royal Canadian Air Force’s flight hours have been significantly less than originally anticipated, which has impacted program revenues and the recovery of our costs under this program. We have incurred significant costs and recognized the related sales, of which about $
million are currently included in contract assets on the balance sheet which could become at risk for future recovery. Such assets are recovered based on future flight hours, which are not entirely within our control and are dependent upon aircraft availability and performance and the availability of Canadian government resources. During 2024, we entered into a modification to the In Service Support contract to better align contract scope with the Canadian government’s needs. This modification mitigates but does not eliminate the risk related to future sales and recovery of our costs. We continue to engage in discussions with the Canadian government to potentially restructure certain contractual terms and conditions that may be beneficial to both parties. However, any restructuring discussions may be prolonged or unsuccessful and are dependent upon Canadian government resources and priorities and other factors outside of our control. Under the contract terms as modified, future sales and recovery of costs are dependent upon the Royal Canadian Air Force’s flight hours and program costs and performance. As of December 31, 2024, cumulative losses remained at approximately $
million. Future performance issues or changes in our estimates may affect our ability to recover our costs, including recovery of the contract assets recognized on the balance sheet and our assessment of the reach-forward loss, which could be material to our operating results.
We also have a number of contracts with Türkish industry for the Türkish Utility Helicopter Program (TUHP), which anticipates co-production with Türkish industry for production of T70 helicopters for use in Türkiye, as well as the related provision of Türkish goods and services under buy-back or offset obligations, to include the future sales of helicopters built in Türkiye for sale globally. In 2020, the U.S. Government imposed certain sanctions on Türkish entities and persons that have affected our ability to perform under the TUHP contracts, and we have provided force majeure notices under the affected contracts. We partially stopped work on TUHP effective October 5, 2024. We are currently in discussions with our customer regarding the path forward for the program in light of the continued impact of the sanctions on our ability to perform under the TUHP contracts and our decision to partially stop work. As of December 31, 2024, cumulative losses related to development work for the program remained insignificant and the program remains in a contract liability position on the balance sheet. The TUHP contracts may be negotiated to be restructured or terminated, either in whole or in part, and as a result, we could be at risk of recording significant reach-forward losses in future periods. Additionally, our customer and subcontractor have asserted that we do not have the contractual right to stop work. If we are unable to reach an agreement in the near term, we or our customer could elect to pursue other relief or remedies, which could result in a further reduction in sales, the imposition of penalties or assessment of damages, and increased unrecoverable costs, which could be material to our financial results.
Our MFC business segment has been performing under a competitively bid classified contract, which includes a cost-reimbursable base contract for the initial phase of the program and multiple fixed-price options for additional phases. We previously disclosed that the options may be exercised over the next several years and if performed expect they would each be at a loss. During the first quarter of 2024, we concluded it was probable that the first option would be exercised and recognized a reach forward loss of approximately $
million. During the fourth quarter of 2024, we again assessed the likelihood that additional options may be exercised and now believe it is probable that all options will be exercised based on performance to date, future requirements of the program, discussions with the customer and suppliers, and anticipated customer funding, among other factors, resulting in the recognition of additional reach-forward losses of approximately $
1.31
billion. For the year ended December 31, 2024, MFC recognized losses of $
1.41
billion for this program, bringing the cumulative losses recognized on the program to approximately $
1.46
billion, including charges for pre-contract costs recognized in prior periods. As of December 31, 2024, $
1.36
billion of the losses were accrued in other current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet.
Research and development and similar costs
– We conduct research and development (R&D) activities using our own funds (referred to as company-funded or independent R&D (IR&D)) and under contractual arrangements with our customers
(referred to as customer-funded R&D) to enhance existing products and services and to develop future technologies. R&D costs include basic research, applied research, concept formulation studies, design, development, and related test activities. Company-funded R&D costs are allocated to customer contracts as part of the general and administrative overhead costs and are generally recoverable to the extent allocable to our cost-reimbursable customer contracts with the U.S. Government. These costs also may be recoverable to the extent allocable to certain fixed-price incentive contracts with the U.S. Government. Customer-funded R&D costs are charged directly to the related customer contracts. Substantially all R&D costs are charged to cost of sales as incurred.
Company-funded R&D costs charged to cost of sales totaled $
1.6
billion, $
1.5
billion and $
1.7
billion in 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Stock-based compensation
– We issue stock-based compensation awards in the form of restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs) that generally vest
three years
from the grant date and are settled in shares. Compensation cost related to all stock-based awards is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award. The grant date fair value of RSUs is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend-equivalent cash payments that are made only upon vesting. The grant date fair value of PSUs is measured in a manner similar to RSUs for awards that vest based on service and performance conditions or using a Monte Carlo model for awards that vest based on service and market conditions.
For all RSUs, we recognize the grant date fair value, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the requisite service period, which is shorter than the vesting period if the employee is retirement eligible on the date of grant or will become retirement eligible before the end of the vesting period. For PSUs that vest based on service and performance conditions, we recognize the grant date fair value, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period based on the number of awards expected to ultimately vest. For PSUs that vest based on service and market conditions, we recognize the grant date fair value, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period. At each reporting date, estimated forfeitures for all stock-based compensation awards and the number of PSUs expected to vest based on service and performance conditions is adjusted.
Income taxes
– We calculate our provision for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences that exist between the financial statement carrying amount of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as well as from operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards. The provision for income taxes differs from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. We measure deferred tax assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates that will apply in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to be recovered or paid.
We periodically assess our tax exposures related to periods that are open to examination. Based on the latest available information, we evaluate our tax positions to determine whether the position will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or other taxing authorities. If we cannot reach a more-likely-than-not determination, no benefit is recorded. If we determine that the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, we record the largest amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be realized when the tax position is settled. We record interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense on our consolidated statements of earnings.
In accordance with the regulations that govern cost accounting requirements for government contracts, current state and local income and franchise taxes are generally considered allowable and allocable costs and, consistent with industry practice, are recorded in operating costs and expenses. We generally recognize changes in deferred state taxes and unrecognized state tax benefits in unallocated corporate expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
– Cash equivalents include highly liquid instruments with original maturities of 90 days or less.
Receivables
– Receivables, net represent our unconditional right to consideration under the contract and include amounts billed and currently due from customers. Receivables, net are recorded at the net amount expected to be collected.
There were no significant impairment losses related to our receivables in 2024, 2023 or 2022.
Contract assets
– Contract assets include unbilled amounts typically resulting from sales under contracts when the percentage-of-completion cost-to-cost method of revenue recognition is utilized and revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer. Contract assets are recorded at the net amount expected to be billed and collected. Contract assets are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and include amounts that may be billed and collected beyond one year due to the long-cycle nature of our contracts.
Contract liabilities
– Contract liabilities include advance payments and billings in excess of revenue recognized. Contract liabilities are classified as current based on our contract operating cycle and reported on a contract-by-contract basis, net of revenue recognized, at the end of each reporting period.
Inventories
– We record inventories at the lower of cost or estimated net realizable value. The majority of our inventory represents work-in-process for contracts where control has not yet passed to the customer. Work-in-process primarily consists of labor, material, subcontractor, and overhead costs. In addition, costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded are recorded in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that those costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and services to the customer upon the receipt of the anticipated contract. All other pre-contract costs, including start-up costs, are expensed as incurred. We determine the costs of other inventories such as materials, spares and supplies by using the first-in first-out or average cost methods. If events or changes in circumstances indicate that pre-contract costs are no longer recoverable or the utility of our inventories have diminished through damage, deterioration, obsolescence, changes in price or other causes, a loss is recognized in the period in which it occurs.
Property, plant and equipment
– Property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. The cost of plant and equipment are depreciated generally using accelerated methods during the first half of the estimated useful lives of the assets and the straight-line method thereafter. The estimated useful lives of our plant and equipment generally range from
to
years for buildings and
five
to
years for machinery and equipment. No depreciation expense is recorded on construction in progress until such assets are placed into operation.
We review the carrying amounts of long-lived assets for impairment if events or changes in the facts and circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. We assess impairment by comparing the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the related asset grouping to its carrying amount. If an asset is determined to be impaired, we recognize an impairment charge in the current period for the difference between the fair value of the asset and its carrying amount.
Capitalized software
– We capitalize certain costs associated with the development or purchase of internal-use software. The amounts capitalized are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets and are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the resulting software, which ranges from
two
to
years.
As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, capitalized software totaled $
1.9
billion and $
1.4
billion, net of accumulated amortization of $
3.1
billion and $
2.8
billion. No amortization expense is recorded until the software is ready for its intended use. Amortization expense related to capitalized software was $
million in 2024, $
million in 2023 and $
million in 2022.
Fair value of financial instruments
– We measure the fair value of our financial instruments using observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect internal market assumptions. The following hierarchy classifies the inputs used to determine fair value into three levels:
Level 1 – quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
Level 2 – inputs, other than quoted prices, observable by a marketplace participant either directly or indirectly.
Level 3 – unobservable inputs significant to the fair value measurement.
Investments
–
We hold a portfolio of marketable securities to fund our non-qualified employee benefit plans. A portion of these securities are held in common/collective trust funds and are measured at fair value using Net Asset Value (NAV) per share as a practical expedient. Marketable securities accounted for as trading are recorded at fair value on a recurring basis and are included in
other noncurrent asset
s on our consolidated balance sheets. Gains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings.
We make investments in companies that we believe are advancing or developing new technologies applicable to our business. These investments are primarily in early-stage companies and may be in the form of common or preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt
securities, investments in funds or equity method investments. Most of these investments are in equity securities without readily determinable fair values (privately held securities), which are measured initially at cost and are then adjusted to fair value only if there is an observable price change or reduced for impairment, if applicable.
The carrying amounts of the investments were
$
million and $
million at
December 31, 2024
and
December 31, 2023 and are included on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent. Changes in fair value and/or sales of investments are reflected in the other non-operating income, net account on our consolidated statements of earnings. We recorded net gains of $
million ($
million, or $
0.07
per share, after-tax), net losses of $
million ($
million, or $
0.19
per share, after-tax) and $
million ($
million, or $
0.33
per share, after-tax) during 2024, 2023 and 2022.
Equity method investments
– Investments where we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but do not control, are accounted for under the equity method of accounting and are included in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Significant influence typically exists if we have a 20% to 50% ownership interest in the investee. Under this method of accounting, our share of the net earnings or losses of the investee is included in operating profit in other income, net on our consolidated statements of earnings since the activities of the investee are closely aligned with the operations of the business segment holding the investment. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of such investments may be impaired. If a decline in the value of an equity method investment is determined to be other than temporary, a loss is recorded in earnings in the current period.
As of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023, our equity method investments totaled $
million and $
million, which was primarily composed of our investment in the United Launch Alliance (ULA) joint venture. Our share of net earnings related to our equity method investees was $
million in 2024, $
million in 2023 and $
million in 2022, of which approximately $
million, $
million and $
million was included in our Space business segment operating profit.
Goodwill and Intangible Assets
– We perform an impairment test of our goodwill at least annually in the fourth quarter or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may be impaired. We may use both a qualitative and quantitative approaches when testing goodwill for impairment. For selected reporting units where we use the qualitative approach, we perform a qualitative evaluation of events and circumstances impacting the reporting unit to determine the likelihood of goodwill impairment. Based on that qualitative evaluation, if we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, no further evaluation is necessary. Otherwise, we perform a quantitative impairment test. We perform quantitative tests for most reporting units at least once every three years. However, for certain reporting units we may perform a quantitative impairment test every year.
To perform the quantitative impairment test we compare the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value, including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying value of the reporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, a goodwill impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. We generally estimate the fair value of each reporting unit using a combination of a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and market-based valuation methodologies such as comparable public company trading values and values observed in recent business acquisitions.
Finite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their applicable useful lives, ranging from
three
to
years, based on the nature of the asset and the underlying pattern of economic benefit as reflected by future net cash inflows.
Acquired intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are subject to annual impairment testing or more frequently if events or change in circumstance indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset is impaired. We perform an impairment test of finite-lived intangibles whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their carrying value may be impaired.
Leases
– We evaluate whether our contractual arrangements contain leases at the inception of such arrangements. Specifically, we consider whether we can control the underlying asset and have the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits or outputs from the asset. Substantially all of our leases are long-term operating leases with fixed payment terms. We do not have significant financing leases. Our right-of-use (ROU) operating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and our operating lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. ROU operating lease assets are recorded in
other noncurrent assets
in our consolidated balance sheet. Operating lease liabilities are recorded in
other current liabilities
or
other noncurrent liabilities
in our consolidated balance sheet based on their contractual due dates.
Both the ROU operating lease asset and liability are recognized as of the lease commencement date at the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate that can readily be determined. Therefore, we use a discount rate based on our incremental borrowing rate, which is determined using our credit rating and information available as of the commencement date. ROU operating lease assets include lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, net of any lease incentives.
Our operating lease agreements may include options to extend the lease term or terminate it early. We include options to extend or terminate leases in the ROU operating lease asset and liability when it is reasonably certain we will exercise these options. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in cost of sales on our consolidated statement of earnings.
We have operating lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The non-lease components in our arrangements are not significant when compared to the lease components. For all operating leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to
recognize operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. We evaluate ROU assets for impairment consistent with our property, plant and equipment policy.
Postretirement benefit plans
– Many of our employees and retirees participate in defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and other postemployment plans (collectively, postretirement benefit plans). Obligation amounts we record related to our postretirement benefit plans are computed based on service to date, using actuarial valuations that are based in part on certain key economic assumptions we make, including the discount rate, the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and other actuarial assumptions including participant longevity (also known as mortality) and health care cost trend rates, each as appropriate based on the nature of the plans.
A market-related value of our plan assets, determined using actual asset gains or losses over the prior three year period, is used to calculate the amount of deferred asset gains or losses to be amortized. These asset gains or losses, along with those resulting from adjustments to our benefit obligation, will be amortized to expense using the corridor method, where gains and losses are recognized over a period of years to the extent they exceed 10% of the greater of plan assets or benefit obligations.
We recognize on a plan-by-plan basis the funded status of our postretirement benefit plans as either an asset recorded within other noncurrent assets or a liability recorded within noncurrent liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets. The GAAP funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the benefit obligation of the plan. The funded status under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA), as amended, is calculated on a different basis than under GAAP.
Postemployment plans
–
We record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, typically when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.
Environmental matters
– We record a liability for environmental matters when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation at a particular site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. Our environmental liabilities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other liabilities, both current and noncurrent. We expect to include a substantial portion of environmental costs in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government regulation. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record assets for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs, and efforts by some U.S. Government representatives to limit such reimbursement. We include the portions of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. government contracts, or determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established or adjusted. Our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets within other assets, both current and noncurrent. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately
years.
Derivative financial instruments
– Derivatives are recorded at their fair value and included in
other current and noncurrent assets
and
liabilities
on our consolidated balance sheets. The classification of gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair values of derivatives is dependent on our intended use of the derivative and its resulting designation. Adjustments to reflect changes in fair values of derivatives attributable to highly effective hedges are either reflected in earnings and largely offset by corresponding adjustments to the hedged items or reflected net of income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss until the hedged transaction is recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of the derivatives that are not highly effective, if any, are immediately recognized in earnings.
Recent Accounting Pronouncements
In November 2024, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2024-03, Income Statement – Reporting Comprehensive Income – Expense Disaggregation Disclosures (Subtopic 220-40): Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses. This ASU requires an entity to disclose the amounts of purchases of inventory, employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization included in each relevant expense caption. It also requires an entity to include certain amounts that are already required to be disclosed under current GAAP in the same disclosure. Additionally, it requires an entity to disclose a qualitative description of the amounts remaining in relevant expense captions that are not separately disaggregated quantitatively, and to disclose the total amount of selling expenses and, in annual reporting periods, an entity’s definition of selling expenses. The amendments in the ASU are effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2026 and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2027, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments prospectively for reporting periods after the effective date or retrospectively to any or all prior periods presented in the financial statements. While this ASU will impact only our disclosures and not our financial condition and results of operations, we are currently evaluating when we will adopt the ASU.
In March 2024, the SEC issued a final rule under SEC Release Nos. 33-11275 and 34-99678, The Enhancement and Standardization of Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors, that would require us to provide climate-related disclosures in our annual reports and registration statements beginning with our annual report for the year ending December 31, 2025. The rule would require disclosure of material climate-related risks, our governance and risk management of climate-related risks and any material climate-related targets or goals, greenhouse gas emissions as well as disclosure of the financial statement effects, such as costs and losses resulting from severe weather events and other natural conditions. In April 2024, the SEC released an order staying this final rule pending judicial review of all the petitions challenging the rule. We are in the process of analyzing the impact of the rule and related litigation on our disclosures.
In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standard Update (ASU) No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures, which requires a public entity to disclose significant segment expenses and other segment items on an annual and interim basis and provide in interim periods all disclosures about a reportable segment’s profit or loss and assets that are currently required annually. Additionally, it requires a public entity to disclose the title and position of the Chief Operating Decision Maker (CODM). The ASU does not change how a public entity identifies its operating segments, aggregates them, or applies the quantitative thresholds to determine its reportable segments. We adopted the new standard effective December 31, 2024. As a result, we have enhanced our segment disclosures to include the presentation of cost of sales by segment and the disclosure of our CODMs. The adoption of this ASU affects only our disclosures, with no impacts to our financial condition and results of operations.
In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures, which focuses on the rate reconciliation and income taxes paid. ASU No. 2023-09 requires a public business entity (PBE) to disclose, on an annual basis, a tabular rate reconciliation using both percentages and currency amounts, broken out into specified categories with certain reconciling items further broken out by nature and jurisdiction to the extent those items exceed a specified threshold. In addition, all entities are required to disclose income taxes paid, net of refunds received disaggregated by federal, state/local, and foreign and by jurisdiction if the amount is at least 5% of total income tax payments, net of refunds received. For PBEs, the new standard is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, with early adoption permitted. An entity may apply the amendments in this ASU prospectively by providing the revised disclosures for the period ending December 31, 2025 and continuing to provide the pre-ASU disclosures for the prior periods, or may apply the amendments retrospectively by providing the revised disclosures for all periods presented. We will adopt this ASU prospectively for the period ending December 31, 2025, and it will impact only our disclosures with no impacts to our financial condition and results of operations.
Note 2 –
Earnings Per Share
The weighted average number of shares outstanding used to compute earnings per common share were as follows (in millions):
We compute basic and diluted earnings per common share by dividing net earnings by the respective weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the periods presented. Our calculation of diluted earnings per common share also includes the dilutive effects for the assumed vesting of outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs) based on the treasury stock method.
There were
no
significant anti-dilutive equity awards for the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022. Basic and diluted weighted average common shares outstanding decreased in 2024 compared to 2023 due to share repurchases.

Information on Business Segments
Overview
We operate in
four
business segments: Aeronautics, MFC, RMS and Space. We organize our business segments based on the nature of products and services offered. Following is a brief description of the activities of our business segments:
•
Aeronautics
– Engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture, integration, sustainment, support and upgrade of advanced military aircraft, including combat and air mobility aircraft, unmanned air vehicles and related technologies.
•
Missiles and Fire Control
– Provides air and missile defense systems; tactical missiles and precision strike weapon systems; logistics; fire control systems; mission operations support, readiness, engineering support and integration services; ground vehicles; and energy management solutions.
•
Rotary and Mission Systems
– Designs, manufactures, services and supports various military and commercial helicopters, sea- and land-based missile defense systems, radar systems, laser systems, sea- and air-based mission and combat systems, command and control mission solutions, cyber solutions, simulation and training solutions, and services and supports surface ships.
•
Space
– Engaged in the research and design, development, engineering and production of satellites, space transportation systems, and strategic, advanced strike, and defensive systems. Space provides network-enabled situational awareness and integrates complex space and ground global systems to help our customers gather, analyze and securely distribute critical intelligence data. Space is also responsible for various classified systems and services in support of vital national security systems. Operating profit for our Space business segment also includes our share of earnings for our
% ownership interest in ULA, which provides expendable launch services to the U.S. Government and commercial customers. Our investment in ULA totaled $
million and $
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Selected Financial Data by Business Segment
Net sales and operating profit of our business segments exclude intersegment sales, cost of sales and profit as these activities are eliminated in consolidation and thus are not included in management’s evaluation of performance of each segment. Our Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Operating Officer (COO) serve as our Chief Operating Decision Makers (CODMs) and are responsible for reviewing segment performance and making decisions regarding resource allocation. Our CODMs evaluate each segment’s performance based on metrics such as net sales, operating profit, and other key financial indicators, guiding strategic decisions to align with company-wide goals. Business segment operating profit includes our share of earnings or losses from equity method investees as the operating activities of the equity method investees are closely aligned with the operations of our business segments.
Summary Operating Results
Sales, cost of sales and operating profit for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions):
(a)
See
“
Note 16 – Impairment and Severance Charges
” included in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
Unallocated Items
Business segment operating profit excludes the FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment discussed below, a portion of corporate costs not considered allowable or allocable to contracts with the U.S. Government under the applicable CAS or FAR, and other items not considered part of management’s evaluation of segment operating performance such as a portion of management and administration costs, legal fees and settlements, stock-based compensation expense, changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities for deferred compensation plans, retiree benefits, significant severance charges, significant asset impairments, gains or losses from divestitures, intangible asset amortization expense, and other miscellaneous corporate activities. Excluded items are included in the reconciling item “Unallocated items” between operating profit from our business segments and our consolidated operating profit. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” (under the
caption “Use of Estimates”) for a discussion related to certain factors that may impact the comparability of net sales and operating profit of our business segments.
FAS/CAS Pension Operating Adjustment
Our business segments’ results of operations include pension expense only as calculated under CAS, which we refer to as CAS pension cost. We recover CAS pension and other postretirement benefit plan cost through the pricing of our products and services on U.S. Government contracts and, therefore, recognize CAS pension cost in each of our business segments’ net sales and cost of sales. Our consolidated financial statements must present pension and other postretirement benefit plan income calculated in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) requirements under U.S. GAAP. The operating portion of the total FAS/CAS pension adjustment represents the difference between the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense) and total CAS pension cost. The non-service FAS pension income components are included in non-service FAS pension income in our consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, to the extent that CAS pension cost exceeds the service cost component of FAS pension income (expense), we have a favorable FAS/CAS pension operating adjustment.
Intersegment Sales
Sales between our business segments are excluded from our consolidated and segment operating results as these activities are eliminated in consolidation. Intersegment sales for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions):
Disaggregation of Net Sales
Net sales by products and services, contract type, customer category and geographic region for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions):
(a)
International sales include FMS contracted through the U.S. Government, direct commercial sales with international governments and commercial and other sales to international customers.
Our Aeronautics business segment includes our largest program, the F-35 Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter, an international multi-role, multi-variant, stealth fighter aircraft. Net sales for the F-35 program represented approximately
% of our consolidated net sales during both 2024 and 2023 and
% during 2022.
Capital Expenditures and PP&E Depreciation and Software Amortization
(a)
Includes amortization of purchased intangibles.
Assets
Total assets for each of our business segments were as follows (in millions):
(a)
Corporate assets primarily include cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes, assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery, property, plant and equipment used in our corporate operations, assets held in a trust for deferred compensation plans, and other marketable investments.
Note 4 –
Receivables, net, Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities
Receivables, net, contract assets and contract liabilities were as follows (in millions):
Receivables, net consist of approximately $
1.7
billion from the U.S. Government and $
million from other governments and commercial customers as of December 31, 2024. Substantially all accounts receivable at December 31, 2024 are expected to be collected in 2025. We do not believe we have significant exposure to credit risk as the majority of our accounts receivable are due from the U.S. Government either as the ultimate customer or in connection with foreign military sales.
Contract assets are net of progress payments and performance based payments from our customers as well as advance payments from non-U.S. government customers totaling approximately $
55.6
billion and $
50.5
billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. Contract assets decreased $
million during 2024, primarily due to billings related to the satisfaction or partial satisfaction of performance obligations during 2024 exceeding the revenue recognized (primarily on the F-35 program at Aeronautics). There were
no
significant credit or impairment losses related to our contract assets during 2024 and 2023. We expect to bill our customers for the majority of the December 31, 2024 contract assets during 2025.
Contract liabilities increased $
million during 2024, primarily due to payments received in excess of revenue recognized on these performance obligations. During 2024, we recognized $
5.9
billion of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2023 as revenue. During 2023, we recognized $
5.1
billion of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2022 as revenue. During 2022, we recognized $
4.8
billion of our contract liabilities at December 31, 2021 as revenue.
Note 5 –
Inventories
Inventories consisted of the following (in millions):
Costs incurred to fulfill a contract in advance of the contract being awarded are included in inventories as work-in-process if we determine that those costs relate directly to a contract or to an anticipated contract that we can specifically identify and determine that the contract award is probable, the costs generate or enhance resources that will be used in satisfying performance obligations, and the costs are recoverable (referred to as pre-contract costs). These advanced procurement costs are generally incurred in order to enhance our ability to achieve schedule and certain customer milestones. Pre-contract costs that are initially capitalized in inventory are generally recognized as cost of sales consistent with the transfer of products and
services to the customer upon the receipt of the anticipated contract. All other pre-contract costs, including start-up costs, are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, $
1.5
billion and $
million of pre-contract costs were included in inventories. The increase in pre-contract costs as of December 31, 2024 is primarily driven by the classified contracts at our Aeronautics business segment and Sikorsky helicopter programs at our RMS business segment.
Note 6 –
Property, Plant and Equipment, net
Property, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following (in millions):
Depreciation expense related to plant and equipment was $
million in 2024, $
million in 2023 and $
million in 2022.
Note 7 –
Goodwill and Acquired Intangibles
Changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by business segment were as follows (in millions):
The gross carrying amounts and accumulated amortization of our acquired intangible assets consisted of the following (useful life in years, $ in millions):
Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense primarily on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.
Amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets was $
million for both 2024 and 2023 and $
million in 2022. Estimated future amortization expense is as follows: $
million in 2025; $
million in 2026; $
million in 2027; $
million in 2028; and $
million in 2029.
Note 8 –
Leases
We generally enter into operating lease agreements for facilities, land and equipment. Our ROU operating lease assets were $
1.0
billion at December 31, 2024. Operating lease liabilities were $
1.1
billion, of which $
million were classified as noncurrent, at December 31, 2024. New ROU operating lease assets and liabilities entered into during 2024 were $
million. The weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases were approximately
6.8
years and
3.5
% at December 31, 2024.
We recognized operating lease expense of $
million, $
million and $
million in 2024, 2023 and 2022. In addition, we made cash payments of $
million, $
million and $
million for operating leases in 2024, 2023 and 2022, which are included in cash flows from operating activities in our consolidated statement of cash flows.
Future minimum lease commitments at December 31, 2024 were as follows (in millions):
Note 9 –
Income Taxes
Income Tax Provisions
Federal and foreign income tax expense for continuing operations consisted of the following (in millions):
Our total net state income tax expense was $
million for 2024, $
million for 2023, and $
million for 2022. State income taxes are allowable costs in establishing prices for the products and services we sell to the U.S. Government. Therefore, state income tax expenses are included in our cost of sales, as general and administrative costs. As a result, the impact of certain transactions on our operating profit and of other matters presented in these consolidated financial statements is disclosed net of state income taxes.
A reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax expense to actual income tax expense for continuing operations is as follows (in millions):
(a)
Other, net includes foreign income tax expenses for all years.
The rates for all periods benefited from tax deductions for foreign derived intangible income,
research and development tax credits,
dividends paid to our defined contribution plans with an employee stock ownership plan feature and employee equity awards.
Uncertain Tax Positions
The change in unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in millions):
As of December 31, 2024, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were $
million compared to $
million as of December 31, 2023. The increase in uncertain tax positions did not have a material impact to our effective tax rate and if these uncertain tax positions were to be recognized in future periods, the impact will not be material. As of December 31, 2022, our liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions were $
1.6
billion. The decrease from 2022 to 2023 with a corresponding decrease to net deferred tax assets primarily resulted from our analysis of IRS Notice 2023-63 released on September 8, 2023 confirming that certain expenditures incurred in the performance of cost-type contracts are not subject to research and development capitalization. The reduction in uncertain tax positions did not have a material impact to our effective tax rate. Additionally, we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as part of our income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, our accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits were not material.
Deferred Income Taxes
The primary components of our federal and foreign deferred income tax assets and liabilities at December 31 were as follows (in millions):
(a)
Federal net operating losses obtained in the Terran Orbital transaction described above which do not expire.
(b)
Includes deferred tax assets and liabilities related to lease liability and ROU asset.
We and our subsidiaries file federal income tax returns in the U.S. and income tax returns in various foreign jurisdictions. With few exceptions, the statute of limitations for these jurisdictions is no longer open for audit or examination for the years before 2016 with respect to various foreign jurisdictions and before 2018 for federal income taxes in the U.S.
We withdrew from the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (CAP) program in 2022 starting with our 2021 tax return. Examinations of the years 2018 to 2021 remain under IRS review. We are also subject to taxation in various states and foreign jurisdictions including Australia, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Poland, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subject to, audit or examination and additional assessments by the relevant authorities.
Our federal and foreign income tax payments, net of refunds, were $
1.3
billion in 2024, $
1.8
billion in 2023 and $
1.6
billion in 2022.

Debt
Our total debt consisted of the following (in millions):
Revolving Credit Facility
On August 24, 2022, we entered into a new Revolving Credit Agreement (the Revolving Credit Agreement) with various banks. The Revolving Credit Agreement consists of a $
3.0
billion
five-year
unsecured revolving credit facility, with the option to increase the credit facility by an additional amount of up to $
million (for an aggregate amount of up to $
3.5
billion), subject to the existing lender approval per the terms and conditions of the agreement. Effective August 23, 2024, we amended the Revolving Credit Agreement to extend the expiration date of the Revolving Credit Agreement from August 24, 2028 to August 24, 2029 and removed the existing financial maintenance covenant. The Revolving Credit Agreement is available for any of our lawful corporate purposes, including supporting commercial paper borrowings. Borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement are unsecured and bear interest at rates set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants, including covenants restricting ours and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to encumber assets and our ability to merge or consolidate with another entity. There were
no
borrowings under the Revolving Credit Agreement at
December 31, 2024
and
2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we were in compliance with all covenants contained in the
Revolving Credit Agreement
as well as in our debt agreements.
Commercial Paper
We have agreements in place with financial institutions to provide for the issuance of commercial paper. The outstanding balance of commercial paper can fluctuate daily and the amount outstanding during the period may be greater or less than the amount reported at the end of the period. There were
no
commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of December 31, 2024. We may, as conditions warrant, issue commercial paper backed by our revolving credit agreement to manage the timing of cash flows.
Long Term Debt
On December 11, 2024, we issued a total of $
1.0
billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $
million aggregate principal amount of
4.70
% Notes due December 15, 2031 (the 2031 Notes) and $
million aggregate principal amount of
5.20
% Notes due February 15, 2055 (the 2055 Notes together with 2031 Notes, the Notes). The 2055 Notes were issued as additional notes under the indenture pursuant to the initial 2055 Notes and have the same terms as the initial 2055 Notes other than the date of issuance and the issue price. With the issuance of the 2055 Notes, the aggregate principal amount of outstanding
5.20
% Notes due February 15, 2055 is $
1,050
million. Net proceeds of $
million were received from the offering after deducting pricing discounts and debt issuance costs, excluding accrued interest on the 2055 Notes. The pricing discounts and debt issuance costs are being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the Notes. We will pay interest on the 2031 Notes semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, beginning on June 15, 2025. We will pay interest on the 2055 notes semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning on February 15, 2025. We may, at our option, redeem the Notes of any series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of
% of the principal amount of the Notes to be redeemed or an applicable make-whole amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
On January 29, 2024, we issued a total of $
2.0
billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $
million aggregate principal amount of
4.50
% Notes due 2029 (the 2029 Notes), $
million aggregate principal amount of
4.80
% Notes due 2034 (the 2034 Notes) and $
million aggregate principal amount of
5.20
% Notes due 2064 (the 2064 Notes and, together with the 2029 Notes and 2034 Notes, the Recent Notes). Net proceeds of $
1.98
billion were received from the offering after deducting pricing discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the Recent Notes. We pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year with the first payment made on August 15, 2024. We may, at our option, redeem the Recent Notes of any series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of
% of the principal amount of the Recent Notes to be redeemed or an applicable make-whole amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Recent Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
On May 25, 2023, we issued a total of $
2.0
billion of senior unsecured notes, consisting of $
million aggregate principal amount of
4.45
% Notes due May 15, 2028 (the 2028 Notes), $
million aggregate principal amount of
4.75
% Notes due February 15, 2034 (the 2034 Notes) and $
million aggregate principal amount of
5.20
% Notes due February 15, 2055 (the initial 2055 Notes and, together with the 2028 Notes and 2034 Notes, the Earlier Notes) in a registered public offering. Net proceeds of $
1,975
million were received from the offering after deducting pricing discounts and debt issuance costs, which are being amortized and recorded as interest expense over the term of the Earlier Notes. We paid interest on the 2028 Notes semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 with the first payment made on November 15, 2023. Additionally, we pay interest on the 2034 Notes and the initial 2055 Notes on February 15 and August 15 of each year with the first payment made on August 15, 2023. We may, at our option, redeem the Earlier Notes of any series in whole or in part at any time and from time to time at a redemption price equal to the greater of
% of the principal amount of the Earlier Notes to be redeemed or an applicable make-whole amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The Earlier Notes rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.
We made interest payments of approximately $
million, $
million and $
million during the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022.

Postretirement Benefit Plans
Plan Descriptions
Many of our employees and retirees participate in various postretirement benefit plans including defined benefit pension, retiree medical and life insurance, defined contribution retirement savings, and other postemployment plans. Substantially all of our postretirement benefit obligations relate to U.S. based defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. The majority of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits within limits imposed by federal tax law (referred to as qualified plans). However, certain of our U.S. defined benefit pension plans provide for benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law (referred to as nonqualified plans).
Salaried employees hired after December 31, 2005 are not eligible to participate in our qualified defined benefit pension plans, but are eligible to participate in a qualified defined contribution plan and other retirement savings plans for which they may qualify. They also have the ability to participate in our retiree medical plans, but we do not subsidize the cost of their participation in those plans as we do with employees hired before January 1, 2006. Over the last few years, we have negotiated similar changes with various labor organizations such that new union represented employees do not participate in our defined benefit pension plans. Our defined benefit pension plans for salaried employees were fully frozen effective January 1, 2020, at which time such employees no longer earn additional benefits under the defined benefit pension plans and were transitioned to a defined contribution retirement savings plan.
Qualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Retiree Medical and Life Insurance Plans
FAS Income (Expense)
The pretax FAS income (expense) related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans included the following (in millions):
(a)
During 2022, we recognized a settlement charge of $
1.5
billion related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses for certain defined benefit pension plans that purchased group annuity contracts from an insurance company.
We record the service cost component of FAS income (expense) for our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans in the cost of sales accounts; the non-service components of our FAS income (expense) for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in the non-service FAS pension income (expense) account; and the non-service components of our FAS income (expense) for our retiree medical and life insurance plans as part of the other non-operating income (expense), net account on our consolidated statements of earnings.
Funded Status
The following table provides a reconciliation of benefit obligations, plan assets and net (unfunded) funded status of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and our retiree medical and life insurance plans (in millions):
(a)
Benefit obligation balances represent the projected benefit obligation for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, which is approximately equal to accumulated benefit obligation, and accumulated benefit obligation for our retiree medical and life insurance plans.
(b)
Actuarial gains for our
qualified defined benefit pension plans in
primarily reflect an increase in the discount rate from
5.00
% at December 31, 2023 to
5.625
% at December 31, 2024, which decreased benefit obligations by approximately $
1.8
billion offset by net losses of approximately $
million due to changes in demographic data and assumptions. Actuarial gains for our
retiree
medical and life insurance plans in 2024 primarily reflect an increase in the discount rate from
5.00
% at December 31, 2023 to
5.50
% at December 31, 2024 and gains due to changes in demographic data and assumptions. Actuarial losses for our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2023 primarily reflect a decrease in the discount rate from
5.25
% at December 31, 2022 to
5.00
% at December 31, 2023, which increased benefit obligations by approximately $
million. Actuarial losses for our retiree medical and life insurance plans in 2023 reflect a decrease in the discount rate from
5.25
% at December 31, 2022 to
5.00
% at December 31, 2023.
(c)
Qualified defined benefit pension plans settlements in 2023 include
$
million
in the form of lump-sum settlement payments to former employees who had not commenced receiving their vested benefit payments. The settlement payments had no impact on year 2023 FAS pension
income.
(d)
Actual return on plan assets for our qualified defined benefit pension plans was approximately
% in 2024 and
% in 2023 versus the
6.50
% long-term rate of return assumption.
We are required to recognize the net funded status of each postretirement benefit plan on a standalone basis as either an asset or a liability on our consolidated balance sheet. The funded status is measured as the difference between the fair value of each plan’s assets and the benefit obligation. Each year we measure the fair value of each plan’s assets and benefit obligation on December 31, consistent with our fiscal year end. The fair value of each plan’s benefit obligation reflects assumptions in effect as of the measurement date as described below. For certain of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans the plan assets may exceed the benefit obligation, for which we recognize the net amount as an asset on our consolidated balance sheet. Conversely, for most of our qualified defined benefit pension plans the benefit obligation exceeds plan assets, for which we recognize the net amount as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet.
The following table provides amounts recognized on our consolidated balance sheets related to our qualified defined benefit pension plans and our retiree medical and life insurance plans (in millions):
Differences between the actual return and expected return on plan assets during the year, and changes in the benefit obligation for our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans due to changes in the annual valuation assumptions, generate actuarial gains or losses. Additionally, the benefit obligation for our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans may increase or decrease as a result of plan amendments that affect the benefits to plan participants related to service for periods prior to the effective date of the amendment, which generates prior service costs or credits. Actuarial gains or losses, and prior service costs or credits, are initially deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss and subsequently amortized for each plan into income or (expense) on a straight-line basis either over the average remaining life expectancy of plan participants or over the average remaining service period of plan participants, subject to certain thresholds.
The following table provides the amount of actuarial gains or losses, and prior service costs or credits, recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss related to qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans at December 31 (in millions):
The following table provides the changes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, for actuarial gains or losses and prior service costs or credits due to differences between the actual return and expected return on plan assets and changes in the fair value of the benefit obligation recognized in connection with our annual remeasurement and the amortization during the year for our qualified defined benefit pension plans, retiree medical and life insurance plans, and certain other plans (in millions):
Assumptions Used to Determine Benefit Obligations and FAS (Expense) Income
We measure the fair value of each plan’s assets and benefit obligation on December 31, consistent with our fiscal year end. Benefit obligations as of the end of each year reflect assumptions in effect as of those dates. Expense is based on assumptions in effect at the end of the preceding year or from the most recent interim remeasurement.
The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations at December 31 of each year and FAS expense for each subsequent year were as follows:
The long-term rate of return assumption represents the expected long-term rate of earnings on the funds invested, or to be invested, to provide for the benefits included in the benefit obligations. That assumption is based on several factors including historical market index returns, the anticipated long-term allocation of plan assets, the historical return data for the trust funds, plan expenses and the potential to outperform market index returns. The actual investment return for our qualified defined benefit plans during 2024 was approximately
%.
Plan Assets
Our wholly owned subsidiary, Lockheed Martin Investment Management Company (LMIMCo), has the fiduciary responsibility for making investment decisions related to the assets of our postretirement benefit plans. LMIMCo’s investment objectives for the assets of these plans are (1) to minimize the net present value of expected funding contributions; (2) to ensure there is a high probability that each plan meets or exceeds our actuarial long-term rate of return assumptions; and (3) to diversify assets to minimize the risk of large losses. The nature and duration of benefit obligations, along with assumptions concerning asset class returns and return correlations, are considered when determining an appropriate asset allocation to achieve the investment objectives. Investment policies and strategies governing the assets of the plans are designed to achieve investment objectives within prudent risk parameters. Risk management practices include the use of external investment managers; the maintenance of a portfolio diversified by asset class, investment approach and security holdings; and the maintenance of sufficient liquidity to meet benefit obligations as they come due.
LMIMCo’s investment policies require that asset allocations of postretirement benefit plans be maintained within the following approximate ranges:
The following table presents the fair value of the assets of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans by asset category and their level within the fair value hierarchy (see “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies - Investments” for definition of these levels), which we are required to disclose even though these assets are not separately recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. Certain investments are measured at their Net Asset Value (NAV) per share because such investments do not have readily determinable fair values and, therefore, are not required to be categorized in the fair value hierarchy. Assets measured at NAV have been included in the table below to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to amounts presented in the funded status table above.
(a)
Cash and cash equivalents and equity securities include derivative assets and liabilities with fair values that were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023. LMIMCo’s investment policies restrict the use of derivatives to either establish long or short exposures for purposes consistent with applicable investment mandate guidelines or to hedge risks to the extent of a plan’s current exposure to such risks. Most derivative transactions are settled on a daily basis.
(b)
Fixed income securities include (i) derivative exposure for the liability hedge, which constitutes most of the value in interest rate swaps, and (ii) other derivative exposure with fair values that were not material as of December 31, 2024 and 2023.
(c)
Level 3 investments include
1.0
billion at December 31, 2024 and $
1.1
billion at December 31, 2023 related to buy-in contracts.
(d)
The Lockheed Martin Corporation Master Retirement Trust (MRT) obtained a loan from a third-party financial institution, collateralized by private equity investments, to invest in fixed income securities.
Changes in the fair value of plan assets categorized as Level 3 during 2024 and 2023 were not significant.
Cash equivalents are mostly comprised of short-term money-market instruments or short-term investment funds and are valued at cost, which approximates fair value.
U.S. equity securities and international equity securities categorized as Level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. For U.S. equity securities and international equity securities not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor or categorized as Level 3 if the custodian obtains uncorroborated quotes from a broker or investment manager.
Commingled equity funds categorized as Level 1 are traded on active national and international exchanges and are valued at their closing prices on the last trading day of the year. For commingled equity funds not traded on an active exchange, or if the closing price is not available, the trustee obtains indicative quotes from a pricing vendor, broker or investment manager. These securities are categorized as Level 2 if the custodian obtains corroborated quotes from a pricing vendor.
Fixed income investments categorized as Level 1 are publicly exchange-traded. Fixed income investments, including interest rate swaps, categorized as Level 2 are valued by the trustee using pricing models that use verifiable observable market data (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals and credit spreads), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with similar characteristics. Fixed income investments are categorized as Level 3 when valuations using observable inputs are unavailable. The trustee typically obtains pricing based on indicative quotes or bid evaluations from vendors, brokers or the investment manager. In addition, certain other fixed income investments categorized as Level 3 are valued using a discounted cash flow approach. Significant inputs include projected annuity payments and the discount rate applied to those payments.
Certain fixed income funds are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on the underlying investments and typically redeemable within
days. The NAV is the total value of the fund divided by the number of the fund’s shares outstanding.
Private equity funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models of the underlying securities, which includes unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have terms between
eight
and
years.
Real estate funds consist of partnerships and similar vehicles and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on valuation models and periodic appraisals. These funds typically have terms between
eight
and
years.
Hedge funds generally consist of separate accounts and commingled funds and are recorded using the NAV practical expedient. The NAV valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments. Redemptions in hedge funds generally range from a minimum of
one month
to several months.
Contributions and Expected Benefit Payments
The required funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plans is determined in accordance with ERISA, as amended, and in a manner consistent with CAS and Internal Revenue Code rules. We made $
million of cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2024. There are
no
expected required contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plans in 2025.
The following table presents estimated future benefit payments as of December 31, 2024 (in millions):
We maintain various trusts to fund the obligations of our qualified defined benefit pension plans and retiree medical and life insurance plans. We expect the estimated future benefit payments will be paid using assets in the trusts established for the plans.
Nonqualified Defined Benefit Pension Plans and Other Postemployment Plans
We sponsor nonqualified defined benefit pension plans to provide benefits in excess of qualified plan limits imposed by federal tax law. The gross benefit obligation for these plans was $
million and $
1.0
billion as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, most of which was recorded in the other noncurrent liabilities account on our consolidated balance sheet. We have set aside certain assets totaling $
million and $
million as of December 31, 2024 and 2023 in a separate trust that we expect to use to pay the benefit obligations under our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, most of which were recorded in the other noncurrent assets account on our consolidated balance sheet. We record the gross assets on our consolidated balance sheet, rather than netting such assets with the benefit obligation for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans, because the assets held are diversified and legally the assets may be used to settle other obligations or claims (although that is not our intent). Actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service credits related to our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans that were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss, pretax, totaled $
million and $
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023. We recognized pretax pension expense of $
million in 2024, $
million in 2023 and $
million in 2022 related to
our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans. The assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations and FAS expense for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plans are similar to the assumptions for our qualified defined benefit pension plans described above.
We also sponsor other postemployment and foreign benefit plans, which are accounted for similar to defined benefit pension plans. The benefit obligations, assets, expense, and amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss for other postemployment and foreign benefit plans were not material to our financial condition and results of operations.
Defined Contribution Retirement Savings Plans
We maintain a number of defined contribution retirement savings plans, most with 401(k) features, that cover substantially all of our employees. Under the provisions of these plans, employees can make contributions on a before-tax and after-tax basis to investment funds to save for retirement. For most plans, we make employer contributions to the employee accounts that comprise of a company non-elective contribution and a matching contribution. Company matching contributions are automatically invested in an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) fund, which primarily invests in shares of our common stock. Plan participants can transfer from the ESOP fund into any investment option provided by the respective plan. Our contributions to defined contribution retirement savings plans were $
1.2
billion in both 2024 and 2023. Our defined contribution retirement savings plans held
24.9
million and
26.6
million shares of our common stock at December 31, 2024 and 2023.
Note 12 –
Stockholders’ Equity
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, our authorized capital was composed of
1.5
billion shares of common stock and
million shares of series preferred stock. Of the
million and
million shares of common stock issued and outstanding as of December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023,
million and
million shares were considered outstanding for consolidated balance sheet presentation purposes; the remaining shares were held in a separate trust.
No
shares of preferred stock were issued and outstanding at December 31, 2024 or 2023.
Repurchases of Common Stock
During 2024, we repurchased
7.5
million shares of our common stock in open market purchases for $
3.7
billion. During 2023, we repurchased
13.4
million shares of our common stock for $
6.0
billion pursuant to accelerated share repurchase (ASR) agreements and open market purchases. We also retired an additional
1.5
million shares received for
no
additional consideration in the first quarter of 2023 upon final settlement of an ASR agreement executed in the fourth quarter of 2022.
The total remaining authorization for future common stock repurchases under our share repurchase program was $
9.3
billion as of December 31, 2024, which includes the $
3.0
billion increase to our share repurchase program authorized by our Board of Directors in October 2024. As we repurchase our common shares, we reduce common stock for the $
of par value of the shares repurchased, with the excess purchase price over par value recorded as a reduction of additional paid-in capital. If additional paid-in capital is reduced to zero, we record the remainder of the excess purchase price over par value as a reduction of retained earnings.
Dividends
We paid dividends totaling $
3.1
billion ($
12.75
per share) in 2024, $
3.1
billion ($
12.15
per share) in 2023 and $
3.0
billion ($
11.40
per share) in 2022. We paid quarterly dividends of $
3.15
per share during each of the first three quarters of 2024 and $
3.30
per share during the fourth quarter of 2024; $
3.00
per share during each of the first three quarters of 2023 and $
3.15
per share during the fourth quarter of 2023; and $
2.80
per share during each of the first three quarters of 2022 and $
3.00
per share during the fourth quarter of 2022.
Accumulated Other Comprehensive Loss
Changes in the balance of AOCL, net of taxes, consisted of the following (in millions):
(a)
AOCL related to postretirement benefit plans is shown net of tax benefits of $
2.2
billion at December 31, 2024,
$
2.3
billion at December 31, 2023 and $
2.1
billion at December 31, 2022. These tax benefits include amounts recognized on our income tax returns as current deductions and deferred income taxes, which will be recognized on our tax returns in future years. See “Note 9 – Income Taxes” and “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans” for more information on our income taxes and postretirement benefit plans.
(b)
During 2022, we recognized a noncash, non-operating pension settlement charge of $
1.5
billion ($
1.2
billion, or $
4.33
per share, after-tax) related to the accelerated recognition of actuarial losses included in AOCL for certain defined benefit pension plans that purchased a group annuity contract from an insurance company (see “Note 11 – Postretirement Benefit Plans”).
Note 13 –
Stock-Based Compensation
Stock-Based Compensation Plans
Under plans approved by our stockholders, we are authorized to grant key employees stock-based incentive awards, including options to purchase common stock, stock appreciation rights, RSUs, PSUs or other stock units.
At December 31, 2024, inclusive of the shares reserved for outstanding RSUs and PSUs, we had approximately
7.7
million shares reserved for issuance under the plans. At December 31, 2024, we had no outstanding options to purchase common stock and have not issued stock options to employees since 2012. At December 31, 2024, approximately
5.3
million of the shares reserved for issuance remained available for grant under our stock-based compensation plans. We issue new shares when restrictions on RSUs and PSUs have been satisfied. The minimum vesting period under our equity compensation plan for employees generally is
one year
, although most RSUs granted annually to executives and other key employees vest over
three years
. Award agreements may provide for vesting periods between
one
and
three years
and in certain circumstances less than
one year
, pro-rated vesting periods or vesting following termination of employment in the case of death, disability, divestiture, retirement, change of control or layoff. The maximum term of any award is
years.
During 2024, 2023 and 2022, we recorded noncash stock-based compensation expense totaling $
million, $
million and $
million, which is included as a component of other unallocated, net on our consolidated statements of earnings. The net impact to earnings for the respective years was $
million, $
million and $
million.
As of December 31, 2024, we had $
million of unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of
1.6
years. We received
zero
cash from the exercise of stock options during both 2024 and 2023 and $
million during and 2022. In addition, our income tax liabilities for 2024, 2023 and 2022 were reduced by $
million, $
million and $
million due to recognized tax benefits on stock-based compensation arrangements.
Restricted Stock Units
The following table summarizes activity related to nonvested RSUs:
In 2024, we granted certain employees approximately
0.6
million RSUs with a weighted average grant-date fair value of $
428.43
per RSU. The grant-date fair value of these RSUs is equal to the closing market price of our common stock on the grant date less a discount to reflect the delay in payment of dividend-equivalent cash payments that are made only upon vesting, which occurs at least
one year
from the grant date and most often occurs
three years
from the grant date.
Performance Stock Units
In 2024, we granted certain employees PSUs with an aggregate target award of approximately
0.1
million shares of our common stock. The PSUs generally vest
three years
from the grant date based on continuous service, with the number of shares earned (
% to
% of the target award) depending upon the extent to which we achieve certain financial and market performance targets measured over the period from January 1, 2024 through December 31, 2026. About half of the PSUs were valued at a weighted average grant-date fair value of $
426.70
per PSU in a manner similar to RSUs mentioned above as the financial targets are based on our operating results. The remaining PSUs were valued at a weighted-average grant-date fair value of $
417.72
per PSU using a Monte Carlo model as the performance target is related to our total shareholder return relative to our peer group. We recognize the grant-date fair value of these awards, less estimated forfeitures, as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.

Legal Proceedings, Commitments and Contingencies
Legal Proceedings
We are a party to litigation and other proceedings that arise in the ordinary course of our business, including matters arising under provisions relating to the protection of the environment, and are subject to contingencies related to certain businesses we previously owned. These types of matters could result in fines, penalties, cost reimbursements or contributions, compensatory or treble damages or non-monetary sanctions or relief. We believe the probability is remote that the outcome of each of these matters, including the legal proceedings described below, will have a material adverse effect on the company as a whole, notwithstanding that the unfavorable resolution of any matter may have a material effect on our net earnings and cash flows in the period in which it is recognized. Among the factors that we consider in this assessment are the nature of existing legal proceedings and claims, the asserted or possible damages or loss contingency (if estimable), the progress of the case, existing law and precedent, the opinions or views of legal counsel and other advisers, our experience in similar cases and the experience of other companies, the facts available to us at the time of assessment and how we intend to respond to the proceeding or claim. Our assessment of these factors may change over time as individual proceedings or claims progress.
Although we cannot predict the outcome of legal or other proceedings with certainty, where there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may have been incurred, GAAP requires us to disclose an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss or make a statement that such an estimate cannot be made. We follow a thorough process in which we seek to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, and only if we are unable to make such an estimate do we conclude and disclose that an estimate cannot be made. Accordingly, unless otherwise indicated below in our discussion of legal proceedings, a reasonably possible loss or range of loss associated with any individual legal proceeding cannot be estimated.
Lockheed Martin v. Metropolitan Transportation Authority
On April 24, 2009, we filed a declaratory judgment action against the New York Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Capital Construction Company (collectively, the MTA) asking the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to find that the MTA is in material breach of our agreement based on the MTA’s failure to provide access to sites where work must be performed and the customer-furnished equipment necessary to complete the contract. The MTA filed an answer and counterclaim alleging that we breached the contract and subsequently terminated the contract for alleged default. The primary damages sought by the MTA are the costs to complete the contract and potential re-procurement costs. While we are unable to estimate the cost of another contractor to complete the contract and the costs of re-procurement, we note that our contract with the MTA had a total value of $
million, of which $
million was paid to us, and that the MTA is seeking damages of approximately $
million. We dispute the MTA’s allegations and are defending against them. Additionally, following an investigation, our sureties on a performance bond related to this matter, who were represented by independent counsel, concluded that the MTA’s termination of the contract was improper. Finally, our declaratory judgment action was later amended to include claims for monetary damages against the MTA of approximately $
million. This matter was taken under submission by the District Court in December 2014, after a five-week bench trial and the filing of post-trial pleadings by the parties. We continue to await a decision from the District Court. Although this matter relates to our former Information Systems & Global Solutions business (IS&GS), we retained responsibility for the litigation when we divested IS&GS in 2016.
Environmental Matters
We are involved in proceedings and potential proceedings relating to soil, sediment, surface water, and groundwater contamination, disposal of hazardous substances, and other environmental matters at several of our current or former facilities, facilities for which we may have contractual responsibility, and at third-party sites where we have been designated as a potentially responsible party (PRP). A substantial portion of environmental costs will be included in our net sales and cost of sales in future periods pursuant to U.S. Government regulations. At the time a liability is recorded for future environmental costs, we record assets for estimated future recovery considered probable through the pricing of products and services to agencies of the U.S. Government, regardless of the contract form (e.g., cost-reimbursable, fixed-price). We continually evaluate the recoverability of our assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery by assessing, among other factors, U.S. Government regulations, our U.S. Government business base and contract mix, and our history of receiving reimbursement of such costs. We include the portions of those environmental costs expected to be allocated to our non-U.S. Government contracts, or determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts, in our cost of sales at the time the liability is established or adjusted.
At December 31, 2024 and 2023, the aggregate amount of liabilities recorded relative to environmental matters was $
million and $
million, most of which are recorded in
other noncurrent liabilities
on our consolidated balance sheets. We have recorded assets for the portion of environmental costs that are probable of future recovery totaling $
million and
$
million at December 31, 2024 and 2023, most of which are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.
Environmental remediation activities usually span many years, which makes estimating liabilities a matter of judgment because of uncertainties with respect to assessing the extent of the contamination as well as such factors as changing remediation technologies and changing regulatory environmental standards. We are monitoring or investigating a number of former and present operating facilities for potential future remediation. We perform quarterly reviews of the status of our environmental remediation sites and the related liabilities and receivables. Additionally, in our quarterly reviews, we consider these and other factors in estimating the timing and amount of any future costs that may be required for remediation activities, and we record a liability when it is probable that a loss has occurred or will occur for a particular site and the loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on our estimate of the costs to be incurred for remediation for that site. We do not discount the recorded liabilities, as the amount and timing of future cash payments are not fixed or cannot be reliably determined. We cannot reasonably determine the extent of our financial exposure in all cases as, although a loss may be probable or reasonably possible, in some cases it is not possible at this time to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss. We project costs and recovery of costs over approximately
years.
We also pursue claims for recovery of costs incurred or for contribution to site remediation costs against other PRPs, including the U.S. Government, and are conducting remediation activities under various consent decrees, orders, and agreements relating to soil, groundwater, sediment, or surface water contamination at certain sites of former or current operations. Under agreements related to certain sites in California, New York, United States Virgin Islands and Washington, the U.S. Government and/or a private party reimburses us an amount equal to a percentage, specific to each site, of expenditures for certain remediation activities in their capacity as PRPs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA).
In addition to the proceedings and potential proceedings discussed above, potential new regulations concerning perchlorate and hexavalent chromium at the federal and state level could increase our cleanup costs. If substantially lower cleanup standards are adopted for perchlorate or hexavalent chromium, we expect a material increase in both our estimates for environmental liabilities and the related assets for the portion of costs that are probable of future recovery. The amount that would be allocable to our non-U.S. Government contracts or that is determined not to be recoverable under U.S. Government contracts would be expensed, which may have a material effect on our earnings in any particular interim reporting period.
We also are evaluating the potential impact of new, existing, and contemplated requirements addressing a class of chemicals known generally as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). PFAS are common and appear in products such as fire-fighting foams and stain- and stick-resistant products (e.g., Teflon, stain-resistant fabrics) and have been used in manufacturing processes. Regulations requiring very low PFAS contaminant levels in drinking water could eventually lead to increased cleanup costs at a number of our environmental remediation sites.
Letters of Credit, Surety Bonds and Third-Party Guarantees
We have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds issued on our behalf by financial institutions, and we have directly issued guarantees to third parties primarily relating to advances received from customers and the guarantee of future performance on certain contracts. Letters of credit and surety bonds generally are available for draw down in the event we do not perform. We had total outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds aggregating $
2.7
billion and $
2.9
billion at December 31, 2024 and December 31, 2023. Third-party guarantees do not include guarantees issued on behalf of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.
Additionally, we may guarantee the contractual performance of third parties such as joint venture partners. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, third-party guarantees totaled $
million and $
1.0
billion, of which approximately
% and
% related to guarantees of contractual performance of joint ventures to which we currently are or previously were a party. These amounts represent our estimate of the maximum amounts we would expect to incur upon the contractual non-performance of the joint venture, joint venture partners or divested businesses. Generally, we also have cross-indemnities in place that may enable us to recover amounts that may be paid on behalf of a joint venture partner. Third-party guarantees do not include guarantees issued on behalf of subsidiaries and other consolidated entities.
In determining our exposures, we evaluate the reputation, performance on contractual obligations, technical capabilities and credit quality of our current and former joint venture partners and the transferee under novation agreements all of which include a guarantee as required by the FAR. At December 31, 2024 and 2023, there were no material amounts recorded in our financial statements related to third-party guarantees or novation agreements.
Other Contingencies
On April 22, 2024, the Armed Services Board of Contract Appeals (ASBCA) sustained our claim associated with a contract to modernize and install new engines in C-5 Galaxy aircraft. The ASBCA ruled that we are entitled to $
million for impacts due to excessive “over and above” work performed under the contract plus interest on the amount since the date of our claim in October 2018. During the third quarter of 2024, the Department of Justice filed a notice of appeal of the ASBCA’s decision with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit and, on the anticipated basis of the Government’s appeal, we recognized approximately $
million of sales and operating profit. Subsequently, on December 18, 2024, the Government voluntarily dismissed its appeal of the ASBCA’s decision in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. Following the dismissal, in the fourth quarter of 2024, we recognized the remaining approximately $
million of sales and operating profit and received payment of the full award of approximately $
million, which includes accrued interest, resolving this matter in our favor.
Independent of this matter and as a U.S. Government contractor, we are subject to various audits and investigations by the U.S. Government to determine whether our operations are being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements. U.S. Government investigations of us, whether relating to U.S. Government contracts or conducted for other reasons, could result in civil or criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, fines or penalties being imposed upon us, suspension, proposed debarment, debarment from eligibility for future U.S. Government contracting, or suspension of export privileges. Reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or terminations, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, repayments, fines and penalties could have a material impact on financial condition and results of operations in any particular reporting period, and suspension or debarment could have a material adverse effect on us because of our dependence on contracts with the U.S. Government. U.S. Government investigations often take years to complete and many result in no adverse action against us. We also provide products and services to customers outside of the United States, which are subject to U.S. and foreign laws and regulations and foreign procurement policies and practices. Our compliance with local regulations or applicable U.S. Government regulations also may be audited or investigated.
Additionally, in the normal course of business, we provide warranties to our customers associated with certain product sales. We record estimated warranty costs in the period in which the related products are delivered. The warranty liability is generally based on the number of months of warranty coverage remaining for the products delivered and the average historical monthly warranty payments. Warranty obligations incurred in connection with long-term production contracts are accounted for within the contract estimates at completion.
Note 15 –
Fair Value Measurements
Assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis consisted of the following (in millions):
Substantially all assets measured at fair value, other than derivatives, represent assets held in a trust to fund certain of our non-qualified deferred compensation plan and are recorded in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. As of both December 31, 2024 and 2023, the fair value of our assets held in the trust totaled $
1.8
billion.
Net gains on these securities were $
million and $
million in 2024 and 2023. Gains and losses on these investments are included in other unallocated, net within cost of sales on our consolidated statements of earnings in order to align the classification of changes in the market value of investments held for the plan with changes in the value of the corresponding plan liabilities.
The fair values of mutual funds and certain other securities are determined by reference to the quoted market price per unit in active markets multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs. The fair values of U.S. Government and certain other securities are determined using pricing models that use observable inputs (e.g., interest rates and yield curves observable at commonly quoted intervals), bids provided by brokers or dealers or quoted prices of securities with
similar characteristics. The fair values of derivative instruments, which consist of foreign currency forward contracts, including embedded derivatives, and interest rate swap contracts, are primarily determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates, credit spreads and foreign currency exchange rates.
We use derivative instruments principally to reduce our exposure to market risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. We transact business globally and are subject to risks associated with changing foreign currency exchange rates. We do not enter into or hold derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes. These contracts hedge forecasted foreign currency transactions in order to minimize fluctuations in our earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We designate foreign currency hedges as cash flow hedges. We enter into foreign currency hedges such as forward and option contracts that change in value as foreign currency exchange rates change. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the British pound sterling, the euro, the Canadian dollar, the Australian dollar, the Norwegian kroner and the Polish zloty. We also are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through our borrowing activities. For fixed rate borrowings, we may use variable interest rate swaps, effectively converting fixed rate borrowings to variable rate borrowings in order to hedge changes in the fair value of the debt. These swaps are designated as fair value hedges. For variable rate borrowings, we may use fixed interest rate swaps, effectively converting variable rate borrowings to fixed rate borrowings in order to minimize the impact of interest rate changes on earnings. These swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. We also may enter into derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge accounting, which are intended to minimize certain economic exposures.
The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding interest rate swaps was $
1.3
billion at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The aggregate notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 was $
7.5
billion and $
6.5
billion. The fair values of our outstanding interest rate swaps and foreign currency hedges at December 31, 2024 and 2023 were not significant. Derivative instruments did not have a material impact on net earnings and comprehensive income during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023. The impact of derivative instruments on our consolidated statements of cash flows is included in net cash provided by operating activities. Substantially all of our derivatives are designated for hedge accounting. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies - Derivative financial instruments.”
We also
make investments in early-stage companies that we believe are advancing or developing new technologies applicable to our business.
Investments that have quoted market prices in active markets (Level 1) are recorded at fair value and reflected in other securities while certain investments are categorized as Level 3 when valuations using observable inputs are unavailable. See “Note 1 – Organization and Significant Accounting Policies - Investments.”
In addition to the financial instruments listed in the table above, we hold other financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and debt. The carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated their fair values. The estimated fair value of our outstanding debt was $
20.2
billion and $
18.5
billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023. The outstanding principal amount of debt, including short-term and long-term debt, was $
21.6
billion and $
18.7
billion at December 31, 2024 and 2023, excluding $
1.3
billion of unamortized discounts and issuance costs at both December 31, 2024 and 2023. The estimated fair values of our outstanding debt were determined based on the present value of future cash flows using model-derived valuations that use observable inputs such as interest rates and credit spreads (Level 2).

Impairment and Severance Charges
During 2024, we
recorded charges totaling
$
million
($
million, or $
0.29
per share, after-tax) for trademark and fixed asset impairments as well as severance costs resulting from the strategic review of our Sikorsky business during the second quarter of 2024 due, in part, to the impacts of the U.S. Army announcement to cancel the Future Attack Reconnaissance Aircraft (FARA) program at the conclusion of fiscal year 2024, for which our Sikorsky business was competing.
During 2023, we recorded severance and other charges of $
million ($
million, or
$
0.30
per share, after-tax) associated with s
everance costs for the planned reduction of certain positions across the corporation and asset impairment charges
. Upon separation, terminated employees received lump-sum severance payments primarily based on years of service, the majority of which have been paid.
This action resulted from a review of our business segments and corporate functions and is intended to improve the efficiency of our operations.
During 2022, we recorded severance and other charges totaling $
million ($
million, or $
0.31
per share, after-tax) related to actions at our RMS business segment, which include severance costs for reduction of positions and asset impairment charges. After a strategic review of RMS, these actions improved the efficiency of our operations and better aligned the organization and cost structure with changing economic conditions and changes in program lifecycles.
We generally can recover a portion of severance costs through
the pricing of our products and services to the U.S. Government and other customers in future periods, which will be included in our operating results.

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We performed an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of December 31, 2024. The evaluation was performed with the participation of senior management of each business segment and key corporate functions, under the supervision of the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO). Based on this evaluation, the CEO and CFO concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2024.
Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes.
Our management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024. This assessment was based on the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.
Our independent registered public accounting firm has issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which is below.
Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by Rules 13a-15(d) and 15d‑15(d) of the Exchange Act that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.
Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm
Regarding Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
Board of Directors and Stockholders
Lockheed Martin Corporation
Opinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We have audited Lockheed Martin Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Lockheed Martin Corporation (the Corporation) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024, based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Corporation as of December 31, 2024 and 2023, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2024, and the related notes and our report dated January 28, 2025 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.
We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.
Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.
Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

Equity Compensation Plan Information
The following table provides information about our equity compensation plans that authorize the issuance of shares of Lockheed Martin common stock to employees and directors. The information is provided as of December 31, 2024.
(1)
Column (a) includes, as of December 31, 2024: 1,589,955 shares that have been granted as restricted stock units (RSUs) and 723,136 shares that could be earned pursuant to grants of performance stock units (PSUs) (assuming the maximum number of PSUs are earned and payable at the end of the three-year performance period) under the Lockheed Martin Corporation 2020 Incentive Performance Award Plan (2020 IPA Plan) or predecessor plans and 53,529 stock units payable in stock or cash under the Lockheed Martin Corporation Amended and Restated Directors Equity Plan (Directors Plan) or predecessor plans for non-employee directors. Column (c) includes, as of December 31, 2024, 4,979,206 shares available for future issuance under the 2020 IPA Plan as options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock awards, RSUs or PSUs and 360,774 shares available for future issuance under the Directors Plan as stock options and stock units. Vested stock units are payable to directors upon their termination of service from our Board, except that directors who have satisfied the stock ownership guidelines may elect to have payment of awards made after January 1, 2018 (together with any dividend equivalents thereon) made on the first business day of April following the one-year anniversary of the grant.
(2)
The shares represent annual incentive bonuses and Long-Term Incentive Performance (LTIP) payments earned and voluntarily deferred by employees. The deferred amounts are payable under the Deferred Management Incentive Compensation Plan (DMICP). Deferred amounts are credited as phantom stock units at the closing price of our stock on the date the deferral is effective. Amounts equal to our dividend are credited as stock units at the time we pay a dividend. Following termination of employment, a number of shares of stock equal to the number of stock units credited to the employee’s DMICP account are distributed to the employee. There is no discount or value transfer on the stock distributed. Distributions may be made from newly issued shares or shares purchased on the open market. Historically, all distributions have come from shares held in a separate trust and, therefore, do not further dilute our common shares outstanding. Because the DMICP shares are outstanding, they should be included in the denominator (and not the numerator) of a dilution calculation.
