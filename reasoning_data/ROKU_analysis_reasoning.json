Here’s a more granular breakdown:\n\n*   **Industry Risk (Expanded):** The streaming industry is highly competitive and subject to shifting consumer preferences.  Trends like cord-cutting, increased streaming quality (4K/HDR), and the rise of on-demand content are constantly reshaping the landscape. ROKU needs to be agile and adapt quickly.\n*   **Advertising Revenue Risk (Detailed):**  The reliance on advertising is a significant vulnerability.

ROKU needs robust fraud detection and prevention measures.\n    *   **Ad Fatigue:**  Users are increasingly resistant to ads.

ROKU needs to understand *why* users are leaving.\n    *   **User Experience (UX):**  A poor user experience can lead to frustration and churn.\n    *   **Subscription Fatigue:**  Users may switch to competing services if they find the platform too cluttered or difficult to use.\n*   **Regulatory Risk (Expanded):**  The streaming industry is subject to evolving regulations regarding content distribution, data privacy, and antitrust.\n\n**7. Growth Opportunities – Detailed**\n\n*   **Content Expansion (Expanded):**\n    *   **Original Content:**  Invest more heavily in original programming – series, movies, and specials.  This is a key differentiator.\n    *   **Niche Content:**  Identify and develop content targeting specific demographics or interests (e.g., gaming, sports, true crime).\n    *   **International Expansion:**  Expand into key international markets with high streaming demand (e.g., Europe, Latin America).\n*   **International Expansion (Detailed):**  Focus on markets with high growth potential and favorable regulatory environments.
