        "original_content": "Overview\nBeyond Meat is a leading plant-based meat company offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meats. We build meat directly from plants, an innovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other sensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying the nutritional and environmental benefits of eating our plant-based meat products. Our brand promise, “Eat What You Love,” represents a strong belief that there is a better way to feed our future and that the positive choices we all make, no matter how small, can have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet. By shifting from animal-based meat to plant-based meat, we can positively impact four growing global issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources and animal welfare.\nTo capture this broad market opportunity, we have developed three core plant-based product platforms that align with the largest meat categories globally: beef, pork and poultry. The primary components of animal-based meat—amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, trace minerals and water—are not exclusive to animals and are plentiful in plants. We create our plant-based products using proprietary scientific processes that determine the architecture of the animal-based meat we are seeking to replicate and then we assemble it using plant-derived amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, trace minerals and water. We are focused on continuously improving our products so that eventually they are, to the human sensory system, indistinguishable from their animal-based counterparts.\nAll of our products are made from simple ingredients without GMOs, no added hormones or antibiotics, and 0 mg of cholesterol per serving. As of December 2024, all of our U.S. retail products were certified Kosher and Halal. We are focused on making our products nutritionally dense, with fewer negative attributes relative to their animal protein alternatives.\nAs of December 2024, Beyond Meat branded products were available at approximately 129,000 retail and foodservice outlets in more than 65 countries worldwide, across mainstream grocery, mass merchandiser, club store and natural retailer channels, and various food-away-from-home channels, including restaurants, foodservice outlets and schools. The number of retail and foodservice outlets where Beyond Meat branded products are available was derived from rolling 52-week data as of December 2024 and excludes outlets unique to Beyond Meat Jerky, which we discontinued in 2024 as part of our Global Operations Review.\nResearch, development and innovation are core elements of our business strategy, and we believe they represent a critical competitive advantage for us. Through our Beyond Meat Rapid and Relentless Innovation Program, our team of scientists and engineers focuses on making continuous improvements to our existing product formulations and developing new products across our plant-based beef, pork and poultry platforms. Our state-of-the-art Innovation Center within our Campus Headquarters brings together leading scientists from chemistry, biology, material science, food science and biophysics disciplines who work together with process engineers and culinary specialists to pursue our vision of perfectly building plant-based meat.\nOur Mission\nWe are a mission-driven business with long-standing core values. We strive to operate in a transparent, socially responsible and environmentally sustainable manner and are committed to help solve the major health and global environmental issues which we believe are caused in part by an animal-based protein diet and existing industrial livestock production. We believe our authentic and long-standing commitment to these causes better positions us to build loyalty and trust with current consumers and helps to attract new ones. Our corporate culture embodies these values and, as a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled workforce committed to our mission and our enterprise.\nCost Down Strategy\nA key component of achieving our long-term business strategy is to continue driving the cost of our products down over time, with the aspiration to eventually price at parity with animal-based protein. In response to the difficult environment and the negative impact of certain factors on our business and the overall plant-based meat category, beginning in 2022 we pivoted our focus toward sustainable long-term growth supported by three pillars: (1) driving margin recovery and operating expense reduction through the implementation of lean value streams across our beef, pork and poultry platforms; (2) inventory reduction and cash flow generation through more efficient inventory management; and (3) focusing on near-term retail and foodservice growth drivers while supporting strategic key long-term partners and opportunities. For clarity, lean value streams represent organizing our teams and operational approach in such a way that increases cross-functional collaboration, transparency and ownership of key business processes and initiatives, with an overarching objective of eliminating waste throughout our organization. We believe, if implemented effectively, the use of a lean value stream approach could drive faster speed-to-market of new product launches over time, which in turn could accelerate our net revenue generation, cost of goods sold reduction and gross margin expansion efforts and enable further operating expense reductions, among others.\nIn November 2023, we initiated our Global Operations Review, which involves narrowing our commercial focus to certain anticipated growth opportunities, and accelerating activities that prioritize gross margin expansion and cash generation. These efforts have to date included, and may in the future include, the exit or discontinuation of select product lines such as Beyond Meat Jerky; changes to our pricing architecture within certain channels; cash-accretive inventory reduction initiatives; non-cash charges such as provision for excess and obsolete inventory and potential additional impairment charges, write-offs and disposals of fixed assets, and losses on sale and write-down of fixed assets; further optimization of our manufacturing capacity and real estate footprint; planned and future reductions in our workforce; and the planned suspension of our operational activities in China. As part of this review, in November 2023, our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 65 employees, representing approximately 19% of our global non-production workforce (or approximately 8% of our total global workforce).\nOn February 24, 2025, our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce in North America and the EU by approximately 44 employees, representing approximately 17% of our global non-production workforce (or approximately 6% of our total global workforce). The decision was based on cost-reduction initiatives intended to reduce operating expenses.\nIn addition, as part of our Global Operations Review, on February 24, 2025, our board of directors approved a plan to suspend our current operational activities in China, which are estimated to cease by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As part of this plan, we are reducing our workforce in China by approximately 20 employees, representing approximately 95% of our China workforce (or approximately 3% of our total global workforce). The decision was based on cost-reduction initiatives intended to reduce operating expenses. See\nNote 15\n, Subsequent Events, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nOur Long-Term Growth Strategy\nIn the long-term, we intend to continue to do the following:\n•\nPursue Top-line Growth Across Our Distribution Channels\nWe continue to believe that there is a significant opportunity over time to expand our retail and foodservice footprint through distribution expansion, continued innovation and commercialization of new products, increased penetration across channels and into other areas of the retail footprint. We believe increased distribution with a global focus will lead to growing consumer awareness and demand for nutritious, convenient and high protein plant-based foods around the world, leading to an increase in the overall size of the plant-based meat category as more consumers shift their diets away from animal-based proteins.\n•\nInvest in Infrastructure and Capabilities\nWe are continually reviewing opportunities to optimize our manufacturing capacity across our network, including identifying opportunities to increase overall equipment effectiveness, leverage our internal manufacturing and co-manufacturer network, and invest in new processes and business management systems to increase automation, improve operating efficiency and enable greater scalability.\n•\nExpand Our Product Offerings\nThe success of our products supports our belief that, despite a further decrease in demand in the plant-based meat category, there will continue to be significant demand for additional plant-based meat products in the long-term. We intend to strengthen our product offerings by improving the formulations for our existing portfolio of products, and by creating new products that expand the portfolio. We are continually refining our products to improve their taste, texture, aroma, appearance and nutrition profile, and to lower their cost of production. In addition, we are committed to investing in research and development to continue to innovate within our core plant-based platforms of beef, pork and poultry to create exciting new product lines.\nIn 2024, we launched the Beyond IV generation of products in the U.S. retail channel. The Beyond Burger IV and Beyond Beef IV generation of products feature a protein blend including yellow pea, brown rice, faba bean, and red lentil proteins as well as an oil system featuring avocado oil. These products are Clean Label Project certified, the first plant-based meat product to receive this certification. Also launched in the U.S. retail channel in 2024, the Beyond Sausage IV generation of products feature a protein blend including pea protein and rice protein as well as an oil system featuring avocado oil. This product is certified as part of the American Diabetes Association’s Better Choices for Life program. Other products launched in the U.S. retail channel in 2024 included Beyond Sun Sausage, an innovative protein option, and Beyond Bakes, a value-added meal product. In February 2025, we announced an expanded line of Beyond Steak in the U.S. retail channel.\n•\nContinue to Grow Our Brand\nWe intend to continue to develop and preserve our brand and increase awareness of Beyond Meat including an increased focus on improving the health perception of Beyond Meat products with our core consumer groups. We intend to accomplish this with an intentional focus on improving our products, working with trusted leaders within nutrition and medicine, and partnering with organizations like the American Heart Association, American Cancer Society and the American Diabetes Association. We also plan to continue to further drive awareness and relevance of Beyond Meat products with a large-scale audience and create relevant content with our network of celebrities, influencers and brand ambassadors, who have successfully built significant brand awareness for us by supporting our mission and products and incorporating Beyond Meat into their daily lifestyle.\nOur Products\nWe sell a range of plant-based meat products across our three core platforms of beef, pork and poultry. Depending on the product and channel, they are offered in ready-to-cook and ready-to-heat formats. Our products cover an entire day’s menu planning, from breakfast to dinner and snacking in between.\nOur beef platform products contain protein primarily derived from one or a combination of pea protein, rice protein, faba bean protein and wheat gluten. Our 2024 introductions—Beyond Burger IV and Beyond Beef IV—are made with avocado oil and have a simplified ingredient list and continue with the tradition of 0 mg of cholesterol, no added antibiotics or hormones, and no GMOs. In 2024, Beyond Steak was the first plant-based meat product to meet the nutritional guidelines of the American Diabetes Association’s Better Choices for Life program.\nOur pork platform consists of products that are intended to mimic animal-based pork in its various merchandised forms, including dinner sausage links, breakfast sausage patties and links, and ground pork. Our pork platform products include Beyond Sausage, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Links and Beyond Sausage Crumbles. The protein content of our pork platform products is primarily derived from one or a combination of pea protein and rice protein. Our 2024 introduction—Beyond Sausage IV—is made with avocado oil and has a simplified ingredient list with 0 mg of cholesterol, no added antibiotics or hormones, and no GMOs.\nOur poultry platform consists of products that are intended to mimic animal-based chicken in its various merchandised forms, including chicken tenders, chicken nuggets and popcorn chicken. Our primary products under our poultry platform include Beyond Chicken Tenders, Beyond Chicken Nuggets and Beyond Popcorn Chicken. The protein content of our poultry platform products is primarily derived from pea protein, faba bean protein and wheat gluten.\nIn 2024, we launched a new product innovation, Beyond Sun Sausage, not intended to replicate beef, pork or poultry but rather be its own protein option, made with protein primarily derived from one or a combination of yellow pea protein, brown rice protein, red lentil protein and faba bean protein. Beyond Sun Sausage is made with avocado oil and has 0 mg of cholesterol, no added antibiotics or hormones, and no GMOs.\nIn 2024, we introduced our value-added meals (“VAM”) line of products with the launch of Beyond Bakes at select U.S. retail stores. Our VAM line of products focuses on providing convenient, ready-to-heat meal options featuring Beyond Meat plant-based protein. Beyond Bakes introduce consumers to high-quality, plant-based meal solutions that are both delicious and easy to prepare.\nCustomers\nSince the success of the Beyond Burger, we have created a strong presence at leading food retailers across the United States and abroad. As of December 2024, Beyond Meat branded products were available in approximately 27,000 retail outlets in the United States and 38,000 retail outlets internationally.\nWe remain focused on expanding our partnerships with foodservice customers over time, including large full-service restaurant (“FSR”) and QSR customers in the United States and abroad. As of December 2024, Beyond Meat branded products were available in approximately 38,000 foodservice outlets in the United States and 26,000 foodservice outlets internationally.\nWe sell to a variety of customers in the retail and foodservice channels throughout the United States and internationally primarily through distributors who purchase, store, sell and deliver our products. Because such distributors function in an intermediary role, we do not consider them to be direct customers. In addition, we sell directly to customers in the retail and foodservice channels who handle their own distribution.\nIn each of 2024, 2023 and 2022, DOT Foods, Inc. (“DOT”) accounted for approximately 12% of our gross revenues. No other distributor or customer accounted for more than 10% of our gross revenues in 2024, 2023 or 2022.\nOur Supply Chain\n•\nSourcing and Suppliers\nThe principal ingredient used to manufacture our products is pea protein. We procure the raw materials for our woven protein from a number of different suppliers. Although most of the raw materials we require are typically readily available from multiple sources, we currently have a limited number of suppliers for the pea protein used in our products.\n•\nSupply Agreements\nWe have a multi-year sales agreement with Roquette Frères (“Roquette”) for the supply of pea protein which expires on December 31, 2025. We are obligated to purchase certain minimum annual amounts as specified in the agreement. We continually seek additional sources of pea protein and other plant-based protein for our products that meet our criteria.\nFlavors consist of product flavors that have been developed by our innovation team in collaboration with our supply partners exclusively for us or in collaboration with our foodservice partners. The formulas are then produced by our suppliers for use in our products. Ingredients in our flavors are qualified through trials to ensure manufacturability. Upon receipt of the ingredients, we receive Certificates of Analysis from our suppliers in our quality control process to confirm that our rigorous standards have been met. Flavors are extensively tested prior to introduction to ensure finished product attributes such as taste, texture, aroma and appearance are not negatively impacted.\nWe have a commitment to purchase flavor ingredients inventory which expires on December 31, 2025. As most of the raw materials we use in our flavors are readily available in the market from many suppliers, we believe that we can within a reasonable period of time make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of an interruption of supply from our vendors.\nManufacturing\nAs the first step in our manufacturing process a dry blend containing our plant protein is combined within our manufacturing facilities. The dry blend then enters our extruder, where both water and steam are added. We then use a combination of heating, cooling and variations of pressure to weave together the proteins into an architecture that mimics the texture and muscle structure of animal meat. The formed woven protein is used as the basis of all our products. Next, internally or through our co-manufacturers, we further process the woven protein by combining flavors and other ingredients, after which the final packaged product is then shipped to third party storage facilities and, ultimately, to distributors or direct to customers. In order to sustain the quality of our products, we have implemented a “define, measure, analyze, improve and control,” or DMAIC, approach to improve, optimize and stabilize our processes and design.\nWe depend on co-manufacturers for the manufacturing of some of our products. We continue to explore further optimization of our production capabilities domestically and abroad to produce our woven proteins, blends of flavor systems and binding systems, and finished goods.\nQuality Control\nIn-process quality checks are performed throughout the manufacturing process, including temperature, physical dimensions and weight. We provide specific instructions to customers and consumers for storing and cooking our products. The majority of our products are transported and stored frozen. Frozen products such as Beyond Beef Crumbles, Beyond Breakfast Sausage Patties, Beyond Steak, Beyond Chicken and Beyond Bakes are intended to be prepared from their frozen state, with cooking instructions printed on all packaging.\nRetail products typically sold in the meat case, such as the Beyond Burger, Beyond Sausage, Beyond Beef, Beyond Meatballs, Beyond Sun Sausage and Beyond Sausage Links, are shipped to the customer frozen. The\ncustomer is provided instructions on ‘slacking,’ which is typically done by moving frozen food to a refrigerator to allow it to slowly and safely thaw, following which retailers must apply a “use by date” sticker to the packaging prior to sale.\nDistribution\nFrom our internal manufacturing or co-manufacturing facilities, products are transferred by third party logistics providers to cold storage facilities or are directly shipped to the customer. International shipments are also handled by third party logistics providers and in some instances are organized directly by the customer.  We manage shipments through transport management systems for real-time shipment tracking and visibility to coordinate our supply chain through to final distribution.\nOrder Fulfillment\nOur customer service and logistics functions are responsible for customer-facing activities, order management, customer logistics, 3PL leadership and intra-company distribution. We utilize enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems and integration with our 3PL cloud interface platforms for these processes. Customer orders are principally transmitted via electronic data interface, but may be processed manually if necessary. Orders are accepted in our ERP systems, reviewed for accuracy and fulfillment plans are developed. When fulfillment plans are ready, orders are tendered to third party carriers. Metrics for the customer service and logistics team include order fill rates, on-time delivery, customer scorecards as needed and cost leadership. We have agreements with third party service providers for all of our shipping needs.\nSales and In-Store Activation\n•\nSales\nAs of December 31, 2024, our sales team is organized into four divisions: retail, foodservice, international and strategic partnerships. The sales team has an extensive range of experience from leading CPG, natural food, meat and plant-based meat companies. It works in close coordination with a network of global broker and distributor partners that gives us the expertise and access to accounts and markets across key global markets in an efficient and scalable fashion as we continue to seek to grow our footprint and sales globally.\nBrand Marketing\nThe primary means by which we have driven consumer awareness of our products is via social and digital media, PR, retail and foodservice shopper marketing, ambassador and influencer activations, paid media and strategic partnerships. Our marketing strategy focuses on driving awareness all the way through to purchase and loyalty.\nWe maintain active social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads, TikTok, X (formerly Twitter) and YouTube to build awareness, share news, reach new audiences and engage with our consumers. These platforms allow us to engage with our consumers and directly reach target demographics such as millennials and “Generation Z.” We also leverage our first party data to distribute brand information and news, foster loyalty through unique offers and share recipe content to drive everyday consumption.\nWe also maintain a registered domain website at www.beyondmeat.com, which serves as the primary source of information regarding our products, as well as foreign domains in certain countries. Our website is used as a platform to promote our products, provide news, share recipes, highlight nutritional facts and provide general information on where to purchase our products.\nWe also partner with a network of brand ambassadors and developed a strong following with certain celebrities from the worlds of sports and entertainment who share our core values. Their organic involvement and interest are helpful to promote our overall mission and strategic partnerships. In 2023, we launched the GoBeyond RD Hub for registered dietitians (“RD”s) and nutrition experts, with the goal of supporting the RD\ncommunity with an open channel for communication and an opportunity to share the latest updates and research insights on plant-based options. In 2024, we continued to deploy targeted brand campaigns to build awareness, reach new users and drive conversion. Our paid digital initiatives included social, programmatic, podcasts, out-of-home, online video, connected TV, and digital offers and rewards.\nCompetition\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment. We believe that we compete with both conventional animal-protein companies, such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods and Tyson, and also plant-based meat brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, such as Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellanova), Moving Mountains, Omnipork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestlé S.A.), Raised & Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco’s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, The Not Company and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever). Additionally, we face competition from companies developing alternative protein sources beyond plant-based offerings. This includes mycelium-based meat alternatives, such as Quorn, Meati and Nature’s Fynd, which leverage fermentation technology to create products with a texture and nutritional profile similar to animal proteins. Furthermore, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or “clean meat,” an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based products.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in our industry are:\n• taste;\n• price and promotion tactics;\n◦\nnutritional profile;\n• ingredients;\n• texture;\n• ease of integration into the consumer diet;\n• low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, low-sodium, high fiber and protein;\n• lack of cholesterol and GMOs;\n• convenience;\n• versatility;\n• brand awareness and loyalty among consumers;\n• media spending;\n• product variety and packaging;\n• access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations;\n• access to major foodservice outlets and integration into menus;\n• innovation; and\n• intellectual property protection.\nWe believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors. However, many companies in our industry have substantially greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market\npresence, longer standing relationships with distributors and suppliers, longer operating histories, greater production, commercialization and distribution capabilities, and greater marketing resources than we have.\nResearch and Development\nAt Beyond Meat, the Research and Development (“R&D”) team is the driving force behind the development of our groundbreaking plant-based meat products. Operating from our Innovation Center located at our Campus Headquarters, our in-house R&D team includes scientists, engineers, researchers, technicians and chefs. In every project they undertake, our R&D team is deeply committed to pioneering the future of food, with a goal of producing plant-based meat alternatives indistinguishable from their animal-based counterparts in taste, texture and nutrition.\nOur R&D efforts have resulted in several industry-first innovations that have not only established new benchmarks in the plant-based meat sector but also significantly contributed to our brand's reputation as an industry leader. To ensure we maintain our competitive advantage, we implement rigorous measures to protect our intellectual property, which forms the cornerstone of our innovative edge.\nThe Beyond Meat Rapid and Relentless Innovation Program defines our systematic and strategic approach to product development. It is a comprehensive framework that integrates the various stages of the innovation lifecycle—ideation, prototype development, testing, refinement and commercialization. Within this framework, each functional team is assigned specific responsibilities and held accountable for their contributions. This structured process ensures that there are clear deliverables at each stage, facilitating a seamless flow from conception to market launch.\nOur R&D endeavors are not limited to product innovation alone. We are equally focused on improving our manufacturing processes and quality control measures. We continuously explore new technologies and methodologies that can improve the efficiency and sustainability of our production lines, with a goal of reducing waste, cost and speed-to-market.\nProduct Innovation\nInnovation is a core competency of ours and an important part of our growth strategy. Our goal is to identify large, animal-based meat product categories across our core plant-based platforms of beef, pork and poultry that exhibit long-term consumer trends. We then dedicate significant research and development resources to create authentic plant-based versions of these products that replicate the taste, texture, aroma and appearance of their animal-based equivalents. We have been able to leverage the success of our existing products and resulting brand equity to launch improved versions of our existing products and create new products. The success and brand equity of our existing product lineup serves as a strong foundation, enabling us to continuously introduce improved versions of our current offerings and launch new, groundbreaking products. Whether new innovation or renovation, all of our product development efforts are driven by a pursuit of excellence, a deep understanding of evolving consumer preferences and a strong commitment to health.\nSeasonality\nGenerally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the U.S. summer grilling season. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, U.S. retail channel net revenues during the second quarter were 21%, 10% and 16% higher than the first quarter, respectively. While we expected to continue to see additional seasonality effects in 2024, as compared to 2023, we saw more muted effects from seasonality in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior-year periods and the second quarter of 2024, reflecting, in part, pricing actions in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels. In general, any historical effects of seasonality have been more pronounced within our U.S. retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel generally tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, driven by increased levels of grilling activity, higher levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. In an environment of heightened uncertainty from potential recessionary and inflationary pressures, prolonged weakness in the plant-based meat category, competition and\nother factors impacting our business, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nAs a disruptive leader in the food industry, we have established ourselves as a leading producer of plant-based meat products that we believe deliver a reduced environmental footprint and mitigate the social and welfare issues associated with the conventional production and consumption of animal protein. In order to continue that work and position us as a leader in the integration of environmental and social change, we have committed to developing a comprehensive ESG program.\nAs part of the development of our ESG program, in 2024 we conducted a materiality analysis to determine which ESG issues are relevant to our business, our stakeholders and society (the “ESG Materiality Analysis”). The term “materiality analysis” is common in the discussion of such assessments; however, the ESG Materiality Analysis was informed by definitions of materiality that differ from, and are in general more expansive than, the definition under the securities laws of the United States. Our discussion of the ESG Materiality Analysis or other ESG matters herein or elsewhere may include information that is not necessarily “material” for SEC reporting purposes, and is informed by various ESG standards and frameworks (including standards for the measurement of underlying data), and the interests of various stakeholders. Much of this information is subject to assumptions, estimates or third party information that is still evolving and subject to change. For example, our disclosures based on any standards may change due to revisions in framework requirements, availability of information, changes in our business or applicable government policies or other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. We continue to work on leveraging the ESG Materiality Analysis to inform our strategy and actions under our commitment to promoting responsible and sustainable business practices within our organization.\nOur focus areas for impact include:\n•\nhuman health;\n•\nclimate change;\n•\nnatural resource conservation; and\n•\nanimal welfare.\nHuman Capital Resources\n•\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2024, we had 754 full-time employees and 54 contract workers. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have never experienced a labor-related work stoppage.\n•\nInclusion and Belonging\nWe value the unique talent and merit that derive from a variety of backgrounds and experience. We aspire to engender and affirm equity and inclusion through a purposeful investment in an environment where qualified individuals can succeed regardless of background. We believe our company culture thrives when different perspectives and ideas inform our strategic goals to innovate and deliver to customers of every socio-economic background. We recognize that representation and collaboration are vital components to address the challenges that face our planet. We have developed a framework of guiding principles that set the foundation for sustainable practices by reducing subjectivity and biases via data-driven decisions and promoting shared ownership for inclusive behaviors and actions across the organization.\n•\nMission, Culture and Engagement\nEverything we do is powered by our mission and core values and our corporate culture reflects that. As a result, we enjoy a highly motivated and skilled workforce committed to our mission and our company. We believe we have a unique culture which promotes employee engagement. Our employees are driven by our mission which promotes collaboration and innovation. We promote employee engagement by organizing various employee activities that are aligned with our mission, including our weekly “Coffee Talk,” a forum for employee engagement with leadership.\nTrademarks and Other Intellectual Property\nWe own domestic and international trademarks and other proprietary rights that are important to our business. Depending upon the jurisdiction, trademarks are valid as long as they are used in the regular course of trade and/or their registrations are properly maintained. Our trademarks are valuable assets that reinforce the distinctiveness of our brand to our consumers. We have applied for or have trademark registrations internationally as well. We believe the protection of our trademarks, copyrights, patents, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets are important to our success.\nWe aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on trademark, copyright, patent, trade dress and trade secret laws and through the domain name dispute resolution system. We maintain a registered domain website at www.beyondmeat.com, as well as foreign domains in certain countries.\nWe believe our intellectual property has substantial value and has contributed significantly to our business. As of December 31, 2024, we had four issued patents in the United States, nine issued patents outside the United States (U.K., Canada, China, Chile, Israel (two), Brazil, Japan and Australia), one pending patent application in the United States, five pending international patent applications and one provisional patent application.\nWe consider the specifics of our marketing, promotions and products as a trade secret, and information we wish to keep confidential. In addition, we consider proprietary information related to formulas, processes, know-how and methods used in our production and manufacturing as trade secrets, and information we wish to keep confidential. We have taken reasonable measures to keep the above-mentioned items, as well as our business and marketing plans, customer lists and contracts reasonably protected, and they are accordingly not readily ascertainable by the public.\nSegment Information\nWe have one operating segment and one reportable segment, in the plant-based meat industry, offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meat. Our chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is our Chief Executive Officer and President, reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire company. We derive revenue primarily in North America and Europe and manage the business activities on a consolidated basis. Our CODM allocates resources and assesses performance at the consolidated level.\nGovernment Regulation\nAlong with our co-manufacturers, brokers, distributors and suppliers, we are subject to extensive laws and regulations in the United States by federal, state and local government authorities and in Canada, the European Union, the United Kingdom, China and other jurisdictions by foreign authorities. In the United States, the primary federal agencies governing the manufacture, distribution, labeling and advertising of our products are the FDA and the FTC, and foreign regulatory authorities include Health Canada or the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (“CFIA”) and the authorities of the EU or the EU member states. Under various federal statutes and implementing regulations and foreign requirements, these agencies, among other things, prescribe the requirements and establish the standards for quality and safety and regulate our product composition, ingredients, manufacturing, labeling and other marketing and advertising to consumers. Among other things, the facilities in which our products and ingredients are manufactured must register with the FDA and any other\nrelevant authorities based on location, comply with current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and comply with a range of food safety requirements established by and implemented under the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 and applicable foreign food safety and manufacturing requirements. Federal, state, and foreign regulators have the authority to inspect our facilities to evaluate compliance with applicable requirements. Federal, state, and foreign regulatory authorities also require that certain nutrition and product information appear on our product labels and, more generally, that our labels and labeling be truthful and non-misleading and that our marketing and advertising be truthful, non-misleading and not deceptive to consumers. We are also restricted from making certain types of claims about our products, including for example, in the United States, nutrient content claims, health claims, and claims regarding the effects of our products on any structure or function of the body, whether express or implied, unless we satisfy certain regulatory requirements.\nIn addition, the United States Congress recently considered (but did not pass) federal legislation, called the Real MEAT Act, that could require changes to our product labeling and marketing, including identifying products as “imitation” meat products.\nIn addition to federal regulatory requirements in the United States, certain states impose their own manufacturing and labeling requirements. For example, every state in which our products are manufactured requires facility registration with the relevant state food safety agency, and those facilities are subject to state inspection as well as federal inspection. Further, states can impose state-specific labeling requirements. For example, in 2018, the state of Missouri passed a law that prohibits any person engaged in advertising, offering for sale, or sale of food products from misrepresenting products as meat that are not derived from harvested production livestock or poultry. The state of Missouri Department of Agriculture has clarified its interpretation that products which include prominent disclosure that the product is “made from plants,” or comparable disclosure such as through the use of the phrase “plant-based,” are not misrepresented under Missouri law. Additional states, including Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, Louisiana, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Texas and Wyoming, have subsequently passed similar laws, and legislation that would impose specific requirements on the naming of plant-based meat products is currently pending in a number of other states, including Arizona and Nebraska. We believe that our products are manufactured and labeled in material compliance with existing state requirements, including the 2018 Missouri law and similarly drafted laws, and pay close attention to any developments at the state or federal level that could apply to our products and our labeling claims.\nWe are also subject to the laws of Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Israel, South Africa, China, the European Union (and individual member countries) and the United Kingdom, among others, and requirements specific to those jurisdictions could impose additional manufacturing or labeling requirements or restrictions. For example, in Europe, the Agriculture Committee of the European Parliament proposed in May 2019 to reserve the use of “meat” and meat-related terms and names for products that are manufactured from the edible parts of animals. In October 2020, the European Parliament rejected the adoption of this provision. In the absence of European Union legislation, EU member states remain free to establish national restrictions on meat-related names. In October 2021, France published a draft implementing decree (the “Contested Decree”), to define, for example, the sanctions in case of non-compliance with the new law. The Contested Decree was published on June 29, 2022, and entered into force on October 1, 2022. At the time, we took the view that the Contested Decree did not comply with the laws of the EU, in particular the principle of free movement of goods. On July 27, 2022, at the request of a trade association, the French High Administrative Court partially suspended the execution of the Contested Decree, signaling serious doubts as to its lawfulness. The Company filed an application for annulment against the Contested Decree and intervened in favor of the trade association in their pending case against the Contested Decree. However, the suspension was only partial and temporary until the High Administrative Court ruled on the merits of the case. We also noted that this prohibition had not been appropriately notified to the European Commission, and that as a result, the prohibition was, in principle, non-enforceable. On July 12, 2023, the French High Administrative Court issued an intermediate judgment in the proceedings against the French meaty names ban. The Court held that there were a number of difficulties interpreting EU law which would be decisive for the resolution of the case. For that reason, the French High Administrative Court referred the case to the Court of Justice of the European Union (“CJEU”), which is the highest court in the EU and can issue a legally binding interpretation of EU law valid in all 27 EU member states, including France. The French High Administrative Court is bound to follow judgments of the CJEU. The\nprocedure before the CJEU started on August 22, 2023, and the Company filed its submission on October 31, 2023. On January 15, 2024, the CJEU closed the written procedure. The period to request an oral hearing closed on February 5, 2024. Meanwhile, on August 23, 2024, France published a proposal for a new decree replacing the Contested Decree (the “New Decree”) which essentially maintained the prohibition on meaty names for products containing a certain percentage of plant-based proteins. Following a mandatory six-month standstill review period by the EU, the New Decree was adopted on February 26, 2024. However, on April 10, 2024, the French High Administrative Court suspended its application, citing serious doubts over its compatibility with EU law. These concerns were already part of the ongoing litigation before the CJEU regarding the original Contested Decree. On March 1, 2024, the CJEU requested the French High Administrative Court to provide its view on the impact of the adoption of the New Decree on the litigation against the Contested Decree, and whether it should be declared moot or it should be allowed to proceed. On March 14, 2024, the French High Administrative Court responded to the CJEU's request for information asking the latter to rule in the proceedings. On April 15, 2024, the CJEU decided that the litigation against the Contested Decree would proceed, and that an oral hearing was not necessary. On October 4, 2024, the CJEU ruled that the Contested Decree’s ban on meat names for plant-based foods was unlawful under EU law, setting a precedent on the extent to which EU member states may regulate the naming of plant-based foods at the national level in the absence of harmonization at the EU level. Following the CJEU’s judgment, the case was referred back to the French High Administrative Court, which, on January 28, 2025, annulled the Contested Decree and the New Decree. Separately, in October 2021, the Turkish authorities challenged the use of the Caped Longhorn superhero logo, as well as the name “Beyond Meat,” alleging that the consumer is misled as to the characteristics of our products. The local distributor has made a submission that this is an unlawful restriction under the EU-Turkey Free Trade Agreement. In December 2021, the Turkish authorities rejected this submission, and held that references to “plant-based” in combination with “meat” would mislead the consumer. In December 2023, Italy adopted a law prohibiting names to indicate foodstuffs of animal origin to describe, market or promote foodstuffs containing vegetable proteins, following the French example. Also in December 2023, Poland published a draft decree banning the use of meaty names to designate plant-based products. In December 2024, South Africa issued proposed draft regulations governing the sale of plant-based meat and other meat analogues.

reduction in our share price due to a substantial number of sales or issuances; decline in our share price and trading volume due to adverse or misleading opinions by securities or industry analysts regarding our business; no history of paying dividends or plans to pay dividends to our stockholders in the foreseeable future; provisions included in our charter documents to delay or prevent a change in control of our company; limitation of stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes due to the exclusive forum provision in our restated certificate of incorporation and forum selection provision in our amended and restated bylaws; and limitation of our ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nRisk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nDisruptions in the worldwide economy, including an economic recession, downturn, periods of rising or high inflation or economic uncertainty, have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe global economy can be negatively impacted by a variety of factors such as the spread or fear of spread of contagious diseases (such as the COVID-19 pandemic, other pandemics, epidemics or other public health crises) in locations where our products are sold, man-made or natural disasters, severe weather, actual or threatened hostilities or war, terrorist activity, political unrest or uncertainties (including those resulting from the recent U.S. presidential and congressional elections), civil strife and other geopolitical uncertainty. Such adverse and uncertain economic conditions may impact distributor, retailer, foodservice and consumer demand for our products. For example, in connection with the war in Ukraine, governments in the U.S., U.K. and the EU have each imposed export controls on certain products and financial and economic sanctions on certain industry sectors and parties in Russia. In addition, the intensity, duration and economic effects of the conflict in Israel, Gaza and surrounding areas are difficult to predict. The uncertainty resulting from the military conflicts in Europe and the Middle East have given rise and may continue to give rise to increases in costs of goods and services, scarcity of certain ingredients, increased trade barriers or restrictions on global trade and may increase volatility in financial and capital markets, which may make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital. Further escalation of geopolitical tensions could have a broader impact that expands into other markets\nwhere we do business, which could adversely affect our business and/or our supply chain, our international subsidiaries, business partners or customers in the broader region, including potential destabilizing effects that such conflicts may pose for the European continent, the Middle East or the global oil and natural gas markets. In addition, our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, retailers, foodservice customers, consumers and creditors may suffer. Political environments, for example the recent change in administration in the U.S., may create uncertainty with respect to, and could result in additional changes in, legislation, regulation, international relations and government policy, or could result in possible civil unrest or other disturbances.\nThe United States has recently signaled its intention to change U.S. trade policy, including potentially renegotiating or terminating existing trade agreements and leveraging tariffs. For example, the current U.S. presidential administration recently announced the implementation of a 25% additional tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 20% additional tariff on imports from China. In response to the U.S. tariffs, China, Canada and Mexico announced plans for their own tariffs on American products. If such increased or additional tariffs or other restrictions, quotas, embargoes, or safeguards are placed on goods imported into the United States, or any related counter-measures are taken by other countries, we may have to raise our prices or increase inventory levels, or find new sources of supply for products that we import. There is no assurance that we would be able to pass on any cost increases, in full or at all, to our customers, and/or we could lose customers in countries such as Canada due to anti-American sentiment, any of which could materially affect our revenue, gross margin and results of operations.\nAny trade wars, through the implementation of tariffs or otherwise, or a government’s adoption of “buy national” policies or retaliation by another government against such tariffs or policies may adversely affect our business, including by impacting (a) our supply chain for our operations as well as third parties with whom we do business, (b) negatively affecting the prices of and demand for the Company’s products and (c) the macroeconomic markets at large. For example, we source substantially all of our pea protein and manufacture some of our products in Canada and such ingredients and products may be subject to tariffs upon import into the U.S., which may negatively impact prices and demand for our products. In addition, prices and demand for our products manufactured in the U.S. may also be negatively affected by trade wars.\nWe cannot predict future trade policy and regulations in the United States and other countries, the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements or treaties, or tariffs and their impact on our business. A trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries increase the price of, or limit the amount of, our products or raw materials used in our products imported into the United States or other countries, or create adverse tax consequences, the sales, cost or gross margin of our products may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products may be diminished. Uncertainty surrounding international trade policy and regulations as well as disputes and protectionist measures could also have an adverse effect on consumer confidence and spending.\nAs global economic conditions continue to be volatile or uncertain and potential recessionary or inflationary pressures exist, trends in consumer discretionary spending also remain unpredictable and subject to changes. We have seen consumers shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns as a result of various factors, including job losses, inflation, higher taxes, reduced access to credit, change in federal economic policy and recent international trade disputes. In particular, consumers have reduced the amount of plant-based food products that they purchase where there are conventional animal-based protein offerings, which generally have lower retail prices. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. A decrease in consumer discretionary spending may also result in consumers reducing the frequency and amount spent on food prepared away from home. Distributors, retailers and foodservice customers have become more conservative in response to these conditions and have sought to reduce their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors, retailers and foodservice customers, our ability to attract new consumers, the financial condition of our consumers and our ability to provide products that appeal to consumers at the right price. Decreases in\ndemand for our products without a corresponding decrease in costs has put downward pressure on gross margin and has negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, our financial results. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions or uncertainty would likely have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nWe have a history of losses, and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe have experienced net losses in almost every period since our inception. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, we incurred net losses of $160.3 million, $338.1 million and $366.1 million, respectively. Although we decreased our operating expenses year-over-year in 2024 and 2023, over time our operating expenses and capital expenditures may increase as we hire additional employees; support our strategic and other QSR customer relationships; innovate and commercialize products; build our brand, expand our marketing channels and drive consumer adoption of our products; optimize our production capacity through our own internal production facilities, domestically and abroad; continue building out our Campus Headquarters, including the timing and success of subleasing, assigning or otherwise transferring excess space or negotiating a partial lease termination at our Campus Headquarters on terms advantageous to us or at all; increase our customer base, supplier network and co-manufacturing partners; scale production across distribution channels; pursue geographic expansion; and enhance our technology and production capabilities. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses, particularly in light of some of the other challenges we face, for example prolonged, weakened demand within the plant-based meat category and broad macroeconomic headwinds. We incur significant expenses in developing our innovative products, building out our facilities, securing an adequate supply of raw materials, obtaining and storing ingredients and other products, and marketing the products we offer. In addition, many of our expenses, including some of the costs associated with our existing and any future manufacturing facilities, are fixed. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully implement our long-term growth strategy or achieve or sustain profitability, and we may incur significant losses for the foreseeable future.\nWeakness in the plant-based meat category, combined with our volume losses, has had a negative impact on our sales and profits.\nOur operating environment continues to be negatively affected by several challenges, including, but not limited to, prolonged, weakened demand in the plant-based meat category overall, particularly in the refrigerated subsegment, among others, adverse changes in consumer taste and perceptions about plant-based meat, broad macroeconomic headwinds including elevated levels of inflation, higher interest rates, waning consumer confidence and potential recessionary concerns, and competitive activity in the plant-based meat category. Consumer demand for plant-based meat products has continued to decline in the U.S. and has softened in certain international markets.\nPartly as a result of this weak demand, we have experienced volume losses and declines from historical levels, which has negatively impacted our sales and profitability. We expect that demand-related challenges will continue to have a negative impact on our sales and profitability and, as a result, our results of operations and financial condition, in the future, particularly if we are not able to continue reducing our costs quickly and significantly enough to offset the lost volume and attain and maintain a profitable customer and product sales mix. A continued decrease in consumer demand for plant-based meat, or a further prolonged decrease, would likely have a material adverse effect on our profits, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur strategic initiatives to improve our cost structure could have long-term adverse effects on our business, and we may not realize the operational or financial benefits from such actions, including achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives.\nIn November 2023, we initiated our Global Operations Review, which involves narrowing our commercial focus to certain anticipated growth opportunities, and accelerating activities that prioritize gross margin expansion and cash generation. These efforts have to date included, and may in the future include, the exit or discontinuation of select product lines such as Beyond Meat Jerky; changes to our pricing architecture within\ncertain channels; cash-accretive inventory reduction initiatives; non-cash charges such as provision for excess and obsolete inventory and potential additional impairment charges, write-offs and disposals of fixed assets, and losses on sale and write-down of fixed assets; further optimization of our manufacturing capacity and real estate footprint; planned and future reductions in our workforce; and the planned suspension of our operational activities in China.\nOur Global Operations Review, cost structure improvement measures, cost-reduction initiatives, workforce reductions, suspension of our operational activities in China, and the timing and success of reducing operating expenses and achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives are subject to many risks and uncertainties. For example, the charges associated with our recent reductions-in-force may be greater than anticipated, and we may be unable to realize the contemplated benefits of any of the foregoing. Additionally, our ability to make progress toward reducing operating expenses and achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives is dependent on a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, demand in the plant-based meat category and for our products, which has continued to decline; our ability to both raise capital and reduce costs and achieve and/or sustain positive gross margin; our ability to grow revenues and meet operating expense reduction targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; timing of capital expenditures; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. The other risks described in this report may also hinder our ability to implement our strategic initiatives. As a result, we cannot guarantee that we will achieve and/or sustain our profitability and financial performance objectives in the future, whether on our expected timelines, or at all.\nWe may also be subject to additional unexpected costs, negative impacts on our cash flows from operating activities, employee attrition and adverse effects on employee morale and potential failure to meet operational and growth targets due to the loss of employees, any of which may impair our ability to achieve anticipated results from our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Additionally, as we are operating our business with fewer employees, we face additional risk that we might not be able to execute on our strategic plans and product roadmap, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs we continue to identify areas of cost savings and operating efficiencies, we may consider implementing further measures to help streamline operations and improve cost efficiencies, which could result in the contraction of our business and the continued implementation of significant cost cutting measures such as further downsizing and exiting certain operations, including product lines, domestically and/or abroad. Any resource realignment, or decision to limit investment in or dispose of or otherwise exit or discontinue product lines or businesses, may result in loss of significant revenues and investments and/or the recording of charges, such as write-offs, further workforce reduction or restructuring costs, charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities or capacity underutilization, exit of co-manufacturing or other arrangements including risk of commercial disputes and other termination and exit costs, lease exit or other related costs, contract termination charges, or claims from third parties. Underutilization or cessation of our manufacturing facilities could adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results and we may be required to terminate or make penalty payments under certain supply chain arrangements, close or idle facilities, write down our long-lived assets, or shorten the useful lives and accelerate depreciation of our assets, which would increase our expenses. In addition, our strategic initiatives may not be adequate to support the long-term operations of our business, particularly under adverse circumstances. Furthermore, we may not be successful in implementing these initiatives or realizing our anticipated savings and efficiencies, including as a result of factors beyond our control. For example, we may not be able to build out or occupy the rest of the Campus Headquarters and are considering subleasing, assigning or otherwise transferring the unoccupied space, or negotiating a partial lease termination but may be unable to enter into or negotiate such an agreement or partial termination, which could have an adverse effect on our operating and financial results. An agreement to partially terminate, sublease, assign or otherwise transfer the unoccupied part of the Campus Headquarters would be subject to certain risks and uncertainties. For example, the agreement may not be completed on terms advantageous to us because the rental rate we receive under the agreement may not fully cover the rental rate we pay under the Campus Lease for the same space or our subtenants may fail to make lease payments, which may result in impairment charges for right-of-use assets and prepaid lease costs and could have a negative impact on our financial\ncondition and results of operations. In addition, a partial termination of the lease could result in a penalty payment to exit the lease and non-cash write-off of prepaid lease costs, the amounts of which could be material and which could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to realize the anticipated savings and efficiencies of our cost-reduction initiatives and related strategic initiatives, our operating and financial results would be adversely affected and could differ materially from our expectations.\nIf we fail to effectively optimize our manufacturing and production capacity, accurately forecast demand for our products or quickly respond to forecast changes, our business and operating results and our brand reputation could be harmed.\nIf we do not have sufficient capacity to meet our customers’ demands and to satisfy increased demand, or are not able to streamline and optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products, we will need to expand our operations, supply and manufacturing capabilities. However, there is risk in our ability to effectively scale production processes, optimize manufacturing capacity for specific products and effectively manage our supply chain requirements. We must accurately forecast demand for each of our products and inventory needs in order to ensure we have adequate available manufacturing capacity for each such product and to ensure we are effectively managing our inventory. Our forecasts are based on multiple assumptions which may cause our estimates to be inaccurate and affect our ability to obtain adequate manufacturing capacity (whether our own manufacturing capacity or co-manufacturing capacity) and adequate inventory supply in order to meet the demand for our products, which could prevent us from meeting increased customer demand and harm our brand and our business and in some cases may result in fines or indemnification obligations we must pay customers or distributors if we are unable to fulfill orders placed by them in a timely manner or at all.\nConsumer demand for plant-based meat products has continued to decline in the U.S. and has softened in certain international markets. For example, in 2024, our U.S. market and channels were negatively impacted by a continued decrease in demand in the category and for our products. If consumer demand for plant-based meats continues to decrease, or if any such decrease is further prolonged, demand for our products by our customers may also continue to decrease. Weakness in the category has had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and continued or worsening weakness would likely have a similar or greater effect, which would in turn make it difficult to accurately predict and forecast demand.\nFurthermore, if we do not accurately align our manufacturing capabilities and inventory supply with demand, if we experience disruptions or delays in our supply chain, or if we cannot obtain raw materials of sufficient quantity and quality at reasonable prices and in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to utilize our capacity efficiently or accurately plan our capacity requirements, which may adversely affect our gross margin, business and operating results.\nIf we overestimate our demand and overbuild our capacity or inventory, as we have done in certain periods in the past, we may have significantly underutilized assets. Underutilization of our manufacturing and/or co-manufacturing facilities can adversely affect our gross margin and other operating results. If demand for our products experiences a prolonged decrease, we may be required to terminate or make penalty payments under certain supply chain arrangements, close or idle facilities, write down our long-lived assets, or shorten the useful lives and accelerate depreciation of our assets, which would increase our expenses. For example, in 2023 and 2022, lower than anticipated revenues negatively impacted our capacity utilization, which resulted in the Company incurring underutilization fees and termination fees that were required in order to exit certain supply chain arrangements.\nIf demand does not materialize at the rate forecasted, we may not be able to scale back our manufacturing expenses or overhead costs quickly enough to correspond to the lower than expected demand. This could result in lower margins and adversely impact our business and results of operations. Additionally, if product demand continues to decrease or stays flat or we fail to forecast demand accurately, our results may be\nadversely impacted due to higher costs resulting from lower manufacturing utilization, causing higher fixed costs per unit produced. Further we may be required to recognize excess or obsolete inventory write-off charges, or excess capacity charges. We routinely monitor and recognize excess or obsolete inventory write-off charges when appropriate, which has negatively impacted our results of operations. For example, in 2023, we recorded incremental provision for excess and obsolete inventory in the amount of $38.0 million primarily arising from our Global Operations Review.\nIf we are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, it could become obsolete, which could require us to write-down or write-off obsolete inventory, which could harm our operating results.\nThere is a risk that we may be unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner to avoid it becoming obsolete. If we are required to substantially discount our inventory or are unable to sell our inventory in a timely manner, we would be required to increase our inventory provision or write-off obsolete inventory and our operating results could be substantially harmed. Alternatively, we may be required to mark down certain products to sell any excess inventory or to sell such inventory through liquidation channels at significantly lower prices, which would negatively impact our business and operating results. For example, in the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, our net revenues were negatively impacted by strategic promotional discounts and our gross profit was negatively impacted by write-down of inventory, among other factors, which increased costs per pound.\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is subject to many risks and uncertainties and our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations.\nOur ability to accurately forecast our future results of operations is limited by and dependent on a number of risks and uncertainties, including those described in this report. Our historical revenue growth should not be considered indicative of our future performance. Our revenue growth has declined and could continue to decline or slow for a number of reasons, including but not limited to weak demand in the plant-based meat category and for our products, other macroeconomic factors such as high inflation, higher interest rates and potential recessionary concerns, reduced consumer confidence and changes in consumer preferences or spending and competitive activity from our market competitors and new market entrants. In fact, net revenues decreased to $326.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2024 from $343.4 million in the prior year, representing a 4.9% decrease. If we are unable to execute our cost-down initiatives, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market and demand for our products may continue to slow, either of which could continue to adversely affect our revenues and margins. If our assumptions regarding these risks and uncertainties and our future revenue generation are incorrect or change, or if we do not address these risks successfully, our operating and financial results could differ materially from our expectations, and our business could suffer.\nFrom time to time, we may release earnings guidance, financial goals or other forward-looking statements in our earnings releases, earnings conference calls or otherwise regarding our future performance that represent our management’s estimates as of the date of the release. Some or all of the assumptions of any future guidance or financial goals that we furnish may not materialize or may vary significantly from actual future results. For example, our ability to make progress toward reducing operating expenses and achieving and/or sustaining our profitability and financial performance objectives is dependent on a number of assumptions and uncertainties, including, without limitation, demand in the plant-based meat category and for our products, which has continued to decline; our ability to both raise capital and reduce costs and achieve and/or sustain positive gross margin; our ability to grow revenues and meet operating expense reduction targets, which may be subject to factors beyond our control; timing of capital expenditures; and our ability to monetize inventory and manage working capital. The other risks described in this report may also cause our actual future results to differ.\nWe estimate market opportunity and forecast market growth that may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market in which we compete achieves the forecasted growth, our business could fail to grow at similar rates, if at all.\nOur estimates of market opportunity and growth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may prove to be inaccurate. The factors that go into the calculation of our market opportunity are subject to change over time and may be variable or inaccurate and may be affected by increasing competition from our market competitors and new market entrants. Any expansion in our market depends on a number of factors, including the cost and perceived value associated with our products and those of our competitors. Even if the market in which we compete meets the size estimates and growth forecast, our business could fail to grow at the rate we anticipate, if at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties.\nBecause we rely on a limited number of third party suppliers, we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis or in sufficient quantities at competitive prices to produce our products or meet the demand for our products.\nWe rely on a limited number of vendors, a portion of whom are located internationally, to supply us with raw materials. In some instances, we purchase raw materials from a single source and may be at an increased risk for supply disruptions. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to arrange for the purchase of raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We have entered into a multi-year sales agreement for plant-based protein with one of our pea protein suppliers pursuant to which we are required to purchase specified minimum monthly and semi-annual quantities through the term. Aside from this agreement and a few select others, we are not assured of continued supply or pricing of raw materials. For example, we do not currently have a long-term supply agreement for avocado oil. Any of our other suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationship with us. We have in the past experienced interruptions in the supply of pea protein from one supplier that resulted in delays in delivery to us. We could experience similar delays in the future from any of our suppliers. Any disruption in the supply of pea protein or other raw materials, such as avocado oil, may have a material adverse effect on our business if we do not have sufficient stocks on hand or if we cannot replace these suppliers in a timely manner, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nIn addition, our pea protein suppliers manufacture their products at a limited number of facilities. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage or other calamity affecting any of these facilities, or any interruption in their operations, could negatively impact our ability to obtain required quantities of pea protein in a timely manner, or at all, which could materially reduce our product sales and net revenues, and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe markets for some of the ingredients we use, such as avocado oil, may be particularly volatile due to factors such as limited supply sources, crop yield, seasonal shifts, climate conditions, industry demand, including as a result of food safety concerns, product recalls and government regulations.\nEvents that adversely affect our suppliers of pea protein and other raw materials, such as avocado oil, could impair our ability to obtain raw material inventory in the quantities at competitive prices that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers’ businesses, finances, labor relations and/or shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, ability to import raw materials, product quality issues, costs, production, insurance and reputation, as well as local economic and political conditions, restrictive U.S. and foreign governmental actions, such as restrictions on transfers of funds and trade protection measures, including export/import duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs, adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in legal or regulatory requirements, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), acts of war, terrorism, natural disasters, fires, earthquakes, flooding, severe weather, agricultural diseases or other catastrophic occurrences. For example, substantially all of our pea protein is sourced from Canada. In February 2025, the United States announced additional tariffs on imports from Canada. Any imposition or increase in tariffs on Canadian imports into the United States could potentially lead to increased costs and potential supply chain disruptions for this ingredient. We continuously seek alternative sources of protein to use in our products, but we may not be successful in diversifying the raw materials we use in our products.\nIf we need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that supplies of raw materials will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that a new supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our strict quality standards.\nIn 2023, we began sourcing avocado oil. Avocado oil is a globally sourced ingredient, however, if we are unable to source avocado oil from preferred regions or suppliers, we may need to diversify our sourcing, which may result in adverse impacts on cost, quality or other aspects of our products or business. There are also increasing expectations that companies monitor and address aspects of the environmental, social and geographic provenance of their products, including inputs from their supply chain.\nIf we are unable to manage our supply chain effectively and ensure that our products are available to meet consumer demand, we may not be able to fulfill customer orders, our operating costs could increase and our profit margins could decrease.\nDisruptions to our supply chain could have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nOur ability to make, move and sell products in coordination with our suppliers, co-manufacturers and distributors is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to our collective supply, manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from severe weather, fires or evacuations related thereto, natural disasters, including climate-related events, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic) or other outbreaks of contagious diseases, agricultural diseases, cyber incidents, security breaches, system failures, terrorism, governmental restrictions or mandates, political instability, trade restrictions, import restrictions, border closures, freight carrier availability, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, the financial or operational instability of key suppliers and carriers, disruptions, repairs or enhancements at facilities manufacturing or delivering our products or other reasons have, in the past, impaired and could, in the future, impair our ability to source inputs or manufacture, sell or timely deliver our products. To the extent we are unable to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, there could be a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nAdditionally, there are increasing expectations in various jurisdictions that companies monitor the environmental and social performance of their suppliers, including compliance with a variety of labor practices, as well as consider a wider range of potential environmental and social matters, including the end of life considerations for products. Compliance can be costly, require us to establish or augment programs to diligence or monitor our suppliers, or, in the case of legislation such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, to design supply chains to avoid certain suppliers or regions altogether. Failure to comply with such regulations can result in fines, reputational damage, import ineligibility for certain products or raw materials, or otherwise adversely impact our business.\nInflationary price pressures of raw materials, labor, transportation, fuel or other inputs used by us and our suppliers, including the effects of higher interest rates, has negatively impacted, and could continue to negatively impact, our business and results of operations.\nOur operating environment has been impacted by inflation and higher interest rates. Increases in the price of raw materials, labor, wages, energy or other inputs that we or our suppliers use in manufacturing and supplying products, along with logistics, transportation, shipping, fuel and other related costs, has led to higher production and shipping costs for our products. Increases in the cost of inputs to our production has led to higher costs for our products in our foodservice and retail channels and has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact our operating results and future profitability. General inflation, including rising energy prices, interest rates and wages, currency volatility and monetary, fiscal and policy interventions by national or regional governments in reaction to such events could continue to have negative impacts on our business by increasing our operating costs and our borrowing costs as well as decreasing the capital available for our customers to purchase our products. Increased borrowing costs faced by our customers could result in decreased demand for our products. The impact of inflation could also continue to reduce consumer confidence and decrease consumer discretionary spending, including spending to purchase our products, and negatively affect trends in consumer purchasing patterns due to changes in consumers’ disposable income, credit\navailability and debt levels. The impact of high inflation and the plant-based meat sector’s premium pricing relative to animal protein have caused and could continue to cause consumers to trade down into cheaper forms of protein, including animal meat, beans and other non-animal meat protein sources.\nOur future business, results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected by reduced or limited availability of plant-based protein or avocado oil that meets our standards.\nOur ability to ensure a continuing supply of ingredients at competitive prices depends on many factors beyond our control, such as the number and size of farms that grow certain crops such as European and North American yellow peas, other plant-based proteins and avocados, the vagaries of these farming businesses (including poor harvests impacting the quality of the peas grown), changes in national and world economic conditions, including as a result of COVID-19 or the outbreak of hostilities or war, tariffs and our ability to forecast our ingredient requirements. The high-quality ingredients used in many of our products are vulnerable to adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as floods, droughts, frosts, earthquakes, hurricanes and pestilence. Adverse weather conditions and natural disasters can lower crop yields and reduce crop size and quality, which in turn could reduce the available supply of, or increase the price of, quality ingredients. In addition, we purchase some ingredients and other materials offshore, and the price and availability of such ingredients and materials may be affected by political events or other conditions in these countries or tariffs, trade wars or the outbreak of hostilities or war. We also compete with other food producers in the procurement of ingredients, and this competition may increase in the future if consumer demand for plant-based meat products increases. If supplies of quality ingredients are reduced or there is greater demand for such ingredients from us and others, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply that meets our strict quality standards on favorable terms, or at all, which could impact our ability to supply products and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on a limited number of distributors, and if we experience the loss of one or more distributors and cannot replace them in a timely manner, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nMany retailers and foodservice providers purchase our products through distributors who purchase, store, sell, and deliver our products to retailers and foodservice providers. In each of 2024, 2023 and 2022, DOT accounted for approximately 12% of our gross revenues. Since these distributors act as intermediaries between us and the retailers and foodservice providers, we do not have short-term or long-term commitments or minimum purchase volumes in our contracts with them that ensure future sales of our products. If we lose one or more of our distributors and cannot replace the distributor in a timely manner or at all, our business, results of operation and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to cost-effectively acquire new customers or retain our existing customers, or if we fail to derive revenue from our existing customers consistent with our historical performance, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur success, and our ability to increase revenues and operate profitably, depends in part on our ability to cost-effectively acquire new customers, to retain existing customers, and to keep existing customers engaged so that they continue to purchase products from us. We intend to continue efforts to expand our number of retail and foodservice customers, both in the United States and internationally, as part of our long-term growth strategy. This may require us to provide marketing and other financial incentives to our customers to assist in the promotion of our products. Such additional incentives could have a negative impact on gross margin and may not necessarily result in increased sales. In addition, foodservice customers will often initially add certain of our product offerings to their menus at limited locations and/or on a limited test basis, after which time these customers may choose to no longer offer our products or may ultimately scale back subsequent expansions. If we fail to attract and retain new customers, or retain our existing customers—some of whom we do not have written contracts with—our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In addition, timing of retail shelf resets are not within our control, and to the extent retail customers change the timing of such events, reduce our in store-displays, are out of stock of our products or are not able to restock our products effectively, sales of our products may be impaired and negatively impact our revenues.\nFurther, if customers do not perceive our product offerings to be of sufficient value and quality, or if we fail to offer new and relevant product offerings at a competitive price, we may not be able to attract or retain customers or engage existing customers so that they continue to purchase products from us. We may lose customers to our competitors if they offer superior products to ours, if we are unable to compete on the basis of value and taste, if we are unable to meet customers’ orders in a timely manner, or if we are unable to identify and execute cost-down initiatives intended to achieve more competitive pricing over time. The loss of any large customer or the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of business from such customers could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nConsolidation of customers or the loss of a significant customer could negatively impact our sales and profitability.\nSupermarkets in North America and the European Union have generally consolidated over time. This consolidation has produced larger, more sophisticated organizations with increased negotiating and buying power that are able to resist price increases, as well as operate with lower inventories, decrease the number of brands that they carry and increase their emphasis on private label products, all of which could negatively impact our business. The consolidation of retail customers also increases the risk that a significant adverse impact on their business could have a corresponding material adverse impact on our business. The loss of any large customer, the reduction of purchasing levels or the cancellation of any business from a large customer for an extended length of time could negatively impact our sales and profitability.\nFurthermore, as retailers consolidate, they may reduce the number of branded products they offer in order to accommodate private label products and generate more competitive terms from branded suppliers competing for limited retailer shelf space. A retailer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot always anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products, pricing and promotions, shelf reset timing and activity, reduced in store-displays, timing of product restocking or the perceived quality of our products. Despite operating in different channels, our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers as our foodservice channel. Because of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, retailers may take actions that negatively affect us.\nLoss of one or more of our co-manufacturers or our failure to timely identify and establish relationships with new co-manufacturers could harm our business and impede our growth.\nA significant amount of our revenue is derived from products manufactured at manufacturing facilities owned and operated by our co-manufacturers, a portion of which are located internationally. Any of the co-manufacturers with whom we do not have a written contract could seek to alter or terminate its relationship with us at any time, leaving us with periods during which we have limited or no ability to manufacture our products. If we need to replace a co-manufacturer, there can be no assurance that additional capacity will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all.\nIf any of our co-manufacturers fail to comply with food safety, environmental, health and safety or other laws and regulations, or face allegations of non-compliance, their operations may be disrupted and our business and reputation could be harmed. An interruption in, or the loss of operations at, one or more of our co-manufacturing facilities, which may be caused by work stoppages, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, production disruptions, product quality or safety issues, local economic and political conditions, restrictive governmental actions, border closures, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), the outbreak of hostilities, acts of war, terrorism, fire, earthquakes, severe weather, flooding or other natural disasters at one or more of these facilities, could delay, postpone or reduce production of some of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition until such time as such interruption is resolved or an alternate source of production is secured.\nWe believe there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-manufacturers in the industry that meet our strict quality and control standards, and as we seek to continue to obtain additional or alternative co-manufacturing arrangements in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so on satisfactory terms, in a timely manner, or at all. The loss of one or more co-manufacturers, any disruption or\ndelay at a co-manufacturer or any failure to identify and engage co-manufacturers for new products, product extensions and expanded operations, including internationally, could delay, postpone or reduce production of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny damage or disruption at our domestic or international manufacturing facilities may harm our business.\nWe have internal manufacturing facilities in the United States, China and the Netherlands to produce our woven proteins and our finished goods. A natural disaster, severe weather, fire, power interruption, work stoppage, labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, outbreaks of pandemics or contagious diseases (such as COVID-19) or other calamity at any of these facilities would significantly disrupt our ability to deliver our products and operate our business. If any material amount of our machinery or inventory were damaged, we would be unable to meet our contractual obligations and cannot predict when, if at all, we could replace or repair such machinery, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a workplace accident or safety incident.\nOur manufacturing processes and related activities could expose us to significant personal injury claims that could subject us to substantial liability. Specifically, our inability to anticipate or preempt potential workplace hazards, create safe working environments or timely adapt to changing requirements around maintaining a safe workplace could result in employee illness, accidents or other safety incidents. A failure to properly train our employees regarding, or respond appropriately and in a timely manner to, any such illness, accident or safety incident could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation. While we maintain liability insurance in amounts and of the type generally consistent with industry practice, the amount of such coverage may not be adequate to cover fully all claims, and we may be forced to bear substantial losses from an accident or safety incident resulting from our manufacturing activities.\nWe may not successfully ramp up operations at our internal manufacturing facilities or these facilities may not operate in accordance with our expectations. Moreover, we face competition for employees and may be unable to hire and retain employees at these facilities.\nSince June 2018, we have acquired internal manufacturing facilities by purchase or lease in the United States, China and the Netherlands. Any substantial delay in bringing these facilities up to full production on our current schedule may hinder our ability to produce all of the product needed to meet orders and/or achieve our expected financial performance. Opening, maintaining and operating these facilities has required, and will continue to require, additional capital expenditures and the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel, which has and will continue to divert resources from our existing business or operations. These efforts may prove more expensive than we anticipate, and we may not succeed in increasing our revenues and margins sufficiently to offset the anticipated higher expenses. Additionally, our inability to hire and retain skilled employees at these facilities will severely hamper our expansion plans, product development and manufacturing efforts. The unemployment rate in the Columbia, Missouri market and the Devault, Pennsylvania market were both 2.4% as of December 2024 and labor market conditions remain relatively tight. As a result, we currently rely on temporary workers in addition to full-time employees, and in the future, we may be unable to attract and retain employees with the skills we require, which could impact our ability to expand our operations. Even if our facilities are brought up to full production according to our current schedule, it may not provide us with all of the operational and financial benefits we expect to receive.\nOur facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products is costly to replace or repair and may require substantial lead-time to do so. For example, our estimate of throughput or our extrusion capacity may be impacted by disruption from extruder lead-in time, calibration, maintenance and unexpected delays. In addition, our ability to procure new extruders may face more lengthy lead times than is typical. We may also not be able to find suitable alternatives with co-manufacturers to replace the output from such equipment on a timely basis and at a reasonable cost. In the future, we may also experience plant shutdowns or\nperiods of reduced production because of regulatory issues, equipment failure, delays in raw material deliveries, food safety incidents or other adverse events. Any such disruption or unanticipated event may cause significant interruptions or delays in our business and the reduction or loss of inventory may render us unable to fulfill customer orders in a timely manner, or at all. As part of our cost-reduction initiatives and our goal of reducing operating expenses, we intend to leverage our existing production infrastructure to meet demand for our products. As a result, if any of our production lines is disrupted, the foregoing risks are likely to be exacerbated. We have property and business disruption insurance in place for all of our internal manufacturing facilities; however, such insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all.\nWe may face difficulties as we expand our operations in other countries, including into those in which we have no prior operating experience.\nWe intend to continue to expand our geographic presence and enter into new markets as part of our long-term growth strategy. To the extent that such geographic expansion eventually requires the establishment of new manufacturing operations in the respective local regions, we could face various challenges. International operations involve a number of risks, including labor shortages, strikes or other labor unrest, border closures, restrictive governmental actions, foreign regulatory compliance, tariffs, taxes and exchange controls, economic downturns, inflation, foreign currency fluctuations, uncertainty in financial markets and banking systems, and political and social instability in the countries in which we operate. Expansion may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate. It may also involve expanding into less developed countries, which may have less political, social or economic stability and less developed infrastructure and legal systems. In addition, it may be difficult for us to understand and accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in these new geographic markets. It is costly to establish, develop and maintain international operations and develop and promote our brands in international markets. As we expand our business into other countries, we may encounter regulatory, legal, personnel, technological and other difficulties that increase our expenses and/or delay our ability to become profitable in such countries, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and brand.\nOur revenue growth rate has fluctuated in recent periods and may continue to slow or decline in the future.\nSince 2022, our revenue growth and revenues have slowed or declined, with periods of negative growth, and may continue to slow or decline further in future periods due to a number of potential factors, including without limitation, macroeconomic issues including inflation and higher interest rates, recessionary concerns, and potential impacts on consumer and customer behavior, and demand levels, increasing competition, market saturation, slowing demand for our offerings, prolonged weakness in the plant-based meat category, increasing regulatory costs and challenges and failure to capitalize on growth opportunities.\nOur revenues and earnings may fluctuate as a result of our promotional activities.\nWe routinely offer sales discounts and promotions through various programs to customers and consumers which may result in reduced margins. These programs include rebates, temporary on-shelf price reductions, off- invoice discounts, retailer advertisements, product coupons and other trade activities. In addition, we have made changes in our pricing architecture including price increases of certain of our products in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels, and may in the future make changes, which may have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results. We continue to face increasing competition across all channels, and expect that trend to continue, especially as additional plant-based meat product brands continue to enter the marketplace and if consumers continue to trade down among proteins in the context of significant inflationary pressure. Moving forward we expect to continue to invest in promotional discounting to address the current consumer trend with more targeted key selling period activations that we expect will allow us to scale back overall trade spending and continue to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products. Although these actions are intended to build brand awareness and increase consumer trials of our products, they have had and are likely to continue to have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results.\nFluctuations in our results of operations for our second and third quarters may impact, and may have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations. Generally, we expect to experience greater demand for certain of our products during the U.S. summer grilling season. In 2024, 2023 and 2022, U.S. retail channel net revenues during the second quarter were 21%, 10% and 16% higher than the first quarter, respectively. While we expected to continue to see additional seasonality effects in 2024, as compared to 2023, we saw more muted effects from seasonality in the third quarter of 2024 as compared to the prior-year periods and the second quarter of 2024, reflecting, in part, pricing actions in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels. In general, any historical effects of seasonality have been more pronounced within our U.S. retail channel, with revenue contribution from this channel generally tending to be greater in the second and third quarters of the year, driven by increased levels of grilling activity, higher levels of purchasing by customers ahead of holidays, the impact of customer shelf reset activity and the timing of product restocking by our retail customers. Any factors that harm our second and third quarter operating results, including disruptions in our supply chain, adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire year. In an environment of heightened uncertainty from potential recessionary and inflationary pressures, prolonged weakness in the plant-based meat category, competition and other factors impacting our business, we are unable to assess the ultimate impact on the demand for our products as a result of seasonality.\nHistorical results are not indicative of future results.\nHistorical quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period comparisons of our sales and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period results. You should not rely on the results of a single quarter or period as an indication of our annual results or our future performance.\nFailure by our transportation providers to deliver our products on time, or at all, could result in lost sales.\nWe currently rely upon third party transportation providers for a significant portion of our product shipments. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, employee strikes, disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19) and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs, if at all. We periodically change shipping companies, and we could face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third party transportation providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have undergone, and may continue to experience, changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, and if we are unable to integrate new members of our executive leadership team or senior management, or if we fail to retain members of our executive leadership team and senior management, our business and operations may be adversely affected.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Ethan Brown, our Founder, President and Chief Executive Officer. These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand, culture and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We do not currently carry key-person life insurance for our senior executives.\nFrom time to time, there may be changes in our executive leadership team and senior management as a result of the hiring, departure or realignment of key personnel, and such changes may impact our business. Over the last few years, we have had several changes to our executive leadership team and senior management, including as a result of organizational changes based on cost-reduction initiatives. Any significant leadership change or senior management transition involves inherent risk and any failure to ensure the timely and suitable replacement and a smooth transition could hinder our strategic planning, business execution and future performance. In particular, these or any future leadership transitions may result in a loss of personnel with deep institutional or technical knowledge and changes in business strategy or objectives and have the potential to disrupt our operations and relationships with employees and customers due to added costs, operational inefficiencies, changes in strategy, decreased employee morale and productivity, and increased turnover. If we are unable to successfully integrate new executive leadership team members and senior management, our operations may be adversely affected and we may not be able to achieve our operating objectives.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain employees or maintain our company culture, we may not be able to grow or successfully operate our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, train and retain a sufficient number of employees who understand and appreciate our culture and can represent our brand effectively and establish credibility with our business partners, customers and consumers. We believe a critical component of our success has been our company culture and long-standing core values. We have invested substantial time and resources in building our team. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of meeting our business needs and expectations, or if we fail to preserve our company culture among a larger number of employees dispersed in various geographic regions, our business and brand image may be impaired. Any failure to meet our staffing needs or any material increase in turnover rates of our employees or key personnel changes may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn 2023, we reduced our workforce by approximately 65 employees, representing approximately 19% of our global non-production workforce (or approximately 8% of our total global workforce). On February 24, 2025, our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce in North America and the EU by approximately 44 employees, representing approximately 17% of our global non-production workforce (or approximately 6% of our total global workforce). In addition, as part of our Global Operations Review, on February 24, 2025, our board of directors approved a plan to suspend our current operational activities in China, which are estimated to cease by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As part of this plan, we are reducing our workforce in China by approximately 20 employees, representing approximately 95% of our China workforce (or approximately 3% of our total global workforce). Any similar reductions in force may adversely affect employee morale, our culture and our ability to attract and retain critical employees. They may also negatively impact our ability to pursue new initiatives due to insufficient resources and personnel. We may be unsuccessful in distributing duties and obligations of impacted employees among the remaining employees. We also may not realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings of any reductions in force and may suffer unintended consequences, such as the loss of institutional knowledge, higher than expected employee turnover and significant disruptions in our day-to-day operations. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies or cost savings from the reductions in force, or if we experience significant adverse consequences as a result, our business, financial conditions and results of operations may be adversely affected. See\nNote 15\n,\nSubsequent Events,\nto the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nSome of our international employees are employed by professional employer organizations.\nOur human resources, payroll and employee benefits functions are not performed by a professional employer organization (“PEO”) for employees in the United States, although we contract with non-U.S. PEOs to perform the same functions for the majority of our employees outside the United States. Although we recruit and select our workers, each of these workers is also an employee of record of the relevant non-U.S. PEO. As a result, these workers are compensated through the relevant PEO, are governed by the work policies created by the relevant PEO and receive their annual wage statements and other payroll or labor related reports from the relevant PEO (e.g., T-4s for employees in Canada). This relationship permits management to focus on\noperations and profitability rather than payroll administration, but this relationship also exposes us to some risks. Among other risks, if any of the non-U.S. PEOs fail to adequately withhold or pay employer taxes or to comply with applicable laws, we may be held liable for such violations notwithstanding any indemnification provisions with the non-U.S. PEOs. In certain non-U.S. jurisdictions, the worker may be deemed a direct employee and the potential liability for any non-compliance with applicable laws increases depending on whether a company has an entity or other corporate presence in the country, among other factors set forth under applicable local laws.\nCourt and administrative proceedings related to matters of employment tax, labor law and other laws applicable to PEO arrangements could distract management from our business and cause us to incur significant expense. If we were held liable for violations by PEOs, such amounts may adversely affect our profitability and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nAn interruption in services provided by third party service providers could adversely affect our business operations.\nWe depend on a limited number of third party service providers for the performance of several of our business operations, including payroll and human capital management services. If any of these third party providers were to experience significant interruptions in their business operations, terminate their agreements with the Company, or fail to perform the services required under the terms of our contracts with them, our business operations could be materially and adversely affected for an indefinite period of time. There can be no assurance that we would be able to locate alternative providers of such services, or that we could do so at economical rates.\nFuture acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nIn the future, we may pursue acquisitions or investments that we believe will help us achieve our strategic objectives. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and even if we do, we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. If we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately achieve our goals or realize the anticipated benefits. The pursuit of acquisitions and any integration process will require significant time and resources and could divert management time and focus from operation of our then-existing business, and we may not be able to manage the process successfully. Any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by our customers or consumers. An acquisition, investment or business relationship may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures, including disrupting our ongoing operations and subjecting us to additional liabilities, increasing our expenses, and adversely impacting our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, we may be exposed to unknown liabilities related to the acquired company or product, and the anticipated benefits of any acquisition, investment or business relationship may not be realized if, for example, we fail to successfully integrate such acquisition into our company. To pay for any such acquisitions, we would have to use cash, incur debt, or issue debt or equity securities, each of which may affect our financial condition or the value of our common stock and could result in dilution to our stockholders. If we incur more debt it would result in increased fixed obligations and could also subject us to covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. Our acquisition strategy could require significant management attention, disrupt our business and harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and reputation could be negatively impacted by ESG matters and/or our reporting of such matters.\nThere is an increased focus from lawmakers, regulators, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders on corporate ESG practices, including climate change and human capital, and related ESG disclosure requirements. Expectations regarding ESG initiatives and disclosures may result in increased costs (including but not limited to increased costs related to compliance, stakeholder engagement, contracting and insurance), changes in demand for certain products, enhanced compliance or disclosure obligations, or other adverse impacts to our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, standards for tracking and reporting ESG matters continue to evolve, and our business may be impacted by new laws, regulations or\ninvestor criteria in the U.S., Europe and around the world related to ESG. These legal and regulatory requirements, as well as investor expectations related to ESG practices and disclosures are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with.\nWhile we may at times engage in voluntary initiatives (such as voluntary disclosures, certifications or goals, among others) to improve the ESG profile of our company and/or products, such initiatives may be costly and may not have the desired effect. Expectations around the Company’s management of ESG matters continues to evolve rapidly, in many instances due to factors that are out of our control. For example, we may not ultimately be able to complete certain goals or initiatives, either on the timelines originally anticipated or at all, due to technical, cost or other factors, which may be in or out of our control. Many ESG initiatives leverage methodologies, standards and data that are complex and continue to evolve. As with other companies, our approach to such matters also evolves, and we cannot guarantee that our approach will align with the expectations or preferences of any particular stakeholder. Moreover, various stakeholders (as well as third party ratings or benchmarks that they may use) have different, and at times conflicting, expectations, which increases the risk that any action may be deemed insufficient or inappropriate by some stakeholders. Any failure to successfully navigate such expectations may result in reputational harm, loss of customers or employees, regulatory or investor engagement, or other adverse impacts on our business. We may be especially subject to scrutiny on such matters given efforts to portray our operations and products as a more sustainable and conscientious alternative to certain competitor products.\nIncreasing governmental and societal attention to ESG matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor and risk oversight, could also expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess and report. For example, to the extent ESG matters negatively impact our reputation, it may also impede our ability to compete as effectively to attract and retain employees, customers, or business partners, which may adversely impact our operations. As another example, various policymakers, including the State of California and the European Union, among others, have adopted (or are considering adopting) requirements for companies to undertake various actions, including disclosures, on climate- or other ESG-related matters. These requirements are not uniform and may not be interpreted or applied uniformly, which may increase the cost and complexity of compliance and any associated risks. Moreover, some policymakers have sought to constrain companies’ consideration of various ESG matters. Such regulatory scrutiny on ESG matters, along with other stakeholder expectations, may enhance any of the risks discussed in this risk factor. If we do not successfully manage and address stakeholder expectations and standards in connection with our ESG initiatives, including any changes in legal requirements or interpretations thereof, our business and reputation could be negatively impacted and our share price and access to/cost of capital could be materially and adversely affected. Additionally, many of our customers and suppliers may be subject to similar expectations, which may augment or create additional risks, including risks that may not be known to us.\nThe Company is subject to accounting estimate risks.\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements. Estimates are made at specific points in time and based on facts, historical experience and various other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances at such time. For example, during the first quarter of 2023, we completed a reassessment of the useful lives of our large manufacturing and research and development equipment, and determined that we should increase the estimated useful lives from a range 5 to 10 years to a uniform 10 years. The timing of this reassessment was based on a combination of factors accumulating over time, including historical useful life information and changes in our planned use of the equipment that provided us with updated information that allowed us to make a better estimate of the economic lives of such equipment.\nThis was accounted for as a change in accounting estimate and was made on a prospective basis effective January 1, 2023. If actual results differ from our judgments and assumptions, then it may have a material, adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. This change in accounting estimate decreased\ndepreciation expense for 2023 by $21.0 million, impacting cost of goods sold and research and development expenses by $19.0 million and $2.0 million, respectively, and decreased both basic and diluted net loss per share available to common stockholders for 2023 by $0.33.\nAny changes in estimates, judgments and assumptions used in the preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP or any future impairment charges could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets (including intangible assets), liabilities, revenues and expenses. This includes estimates, judgments and assumptions for assessing the recoverability of our assets, pursuant to Financial Accounting Standards Board issued authoritative guidance. If any estimates, judgments or assumptions change in the future, the Company may be required to record additional expenses and/or impairment charges. See “—\nThe Company is subject to accounting estimate risks\n.”\nWe base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our actual results may differ from these estimates under assumptions or conditions that may change in the future. While we believe the assumptions and estimates we make are reasonable, any changes to our assumptions or estimates, or any actual results which differ from our assumptions or estimates, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and operating results. Improper design and implementation of internal controls related to the estimates could result in misstatement of financial reports.\nWe perform an asset impairment analysis on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that a long-lived asset group may not be recoverable. Failure to achieve forecasted operating results, due to weakness in the economic environment or other factors, changes in market conditions and declines in our market capitalization, the planned suspension of our operational activities in China, and failure to negotiate a partial lease termination or sublease, assign or otherwise transfer the unoccupied space of our Campus Headquarters, among other things, could result in impairment of our assets and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur results of operations could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes impacting the development of our products and implementation of our business needs.\nOur success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes affecting the development of our products and implementation of our business needs. Emerging technological trends such as artificial intelligence, machine learning and automation are impacting industries and business operations. If we do not sufficiently invest in new technology and industry developments, appropriately implement new technologies or evolve our business at sufficient speed and scale in response to such developments, or if we do not make the right strategic investments to respond to these developments, our products, results of operations and ability to develop and maintain our business could be negatively affected. Our competitors or other third parties may incorporate such technologies into their products and business more quickly or more successfully than us, which could impair our ability to compete effectively and adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Products\nFood safety and food-borne illness incidents, or the perception of related risks, may materially adversely affect our business by exposing us to lawsuits, product recalls or regulatory enforcement actions, increasing our operating costs and reducing demand for our product offerings.\nSelling food for human consumption involves inherent legal and other risks, and there is increasing governmental scrutiny of and public awareness regarding food safety. Unexpected side effects, illness, injury or death related to allergens, food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents caused by products we sell, or involving our suppliers or co-manufacturers, could result in the discontinuance of sales of these products or our relationships with such suppliers or co-manufacturers, or otherwise result in destruction and write-off of raw materials or product inventory, delayed or lost sales, increased operating costs, regulatory enforcement actions or harm to our reputation. Shipment of adulterated or misbranded products, even if inadvertent, can result in criminal or civil liability. Such incidents could also expose us to product liability, negligence or other lawsuits, including consumer class action lawsuits. Any claims brought against us may exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits. Any judgment against us that is more than our policy limits or not covered by our policies or not subject to insurance would have to be paid from our cash reserves, which would reduce our capital resources. Similarly, the perception of risks related to such incidents, whether actual or not, or related to such claims, whether meritorious or not, could have an adverse effect on our brand and reputation.\nThe occurrence of food-borne illnesses or other food safety incidents could also adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients, resulting in higher costs, disruptions in supply and a reduction in our sales. Furthermore, any instances of food contamination or regulatory noncompliance, whether or not caused by our actions, could compel us, our suppliers, our distributors or our customers, depending on the circumstances, to conduct a recall in accordance with FDA regulations, comparable state laws or foreign laws such as those of the European Union, the United Kingdom and China. Food recalls and other food illness and food safety incidents could result in significant losses due to their costs, the destruction of raw materials or product inventory, lost sales due to the unavailability of the product for a period of time and potential loss of existing distributors or customers and a potential negative impact on our ability to attract new customers due to negative consumer experiences or because of an adverse impact on our brand and reputation. The costs of a recall could exceed or be outside the scope of our existing or future insurance policy coverage or limits.\nIn addition, food companies have been subject to targeted, large-scale tampering as well as to opportunistic, individual product tampering, and we, like any food company, could be a target for product tampering. Forms of tampering could include the introduction of foreign material, chemical contaminants and pathological organisms into consumer products as well as product substitution. FDA regulations require companies like us to analyze, prepare and implement mitigation strategies specifically to address tampering (i.e., intentional adulteration) designed to inflict widespread public health harm. If we do not adequately address the possibility, or any actual instance, of intentional adulteration, we could face possible seizure or recall of our products and the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nConsumer preferences for our products are difficult to predict and may change, and, if we are unable to respond quickly to new trends and demands, our business may be adversely affected.\nOur business is focused on the development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of a line of branded plant-based meat products as alternatives to animal-based protein products. Consumer demand has in the past changed and could change again in the future based on a number of possible factors, including dietary habits and nutritional values, concerns regarding the health effects of ingredients and shifts in preference for various product attributes. Decreased consumer demand for our products has caused our business and financial condition to suffer, and any further decrease in, or flattening of, such demand would likely have a similar effect. In addition, sales of plant-based meat or meat-alternative products are subject to evolving consumer preferences that we may not be able to accurately predict or respond to. Consumer trends that we believe favor sales of our products could change based on a number of possible factors, including a shift in preference from\nplant-based meat to animal-based protein products (including any products produced using new farming methods or technologies which may reduce the adverse environmental and other factors associated with conventional animal-based protein products), increased acceptance for different alternative proteins that are used in our products, economic factors and social trends. A significant shift in consumer demand away from our products or the plant-based meat category in general, could reduce our sales or our market share and the prestige of our brand, which would harm our business and financial condition. In addition, if the Beyond IV platform is not widely accepted, our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, lobbyists supporting the meat industry have engaged in marketing campaigns in an attempt to generate negative publicity regarding our products and may continue to do so in the future. Any shift in consumer perception that our products are not healthy as a result of these campaigns could significantly reduce the value of our brand and damage our business. Other types of adverse publicity concerning our business or the plant-based meat industry generally could also harm our brand, reputation and results of operations. The growing use of social and digital media over recent years has amplified the impact of such negative publicity.\nSales of the Beyond Burger contribute a significant portion of our revenue. A reduction in sales of Beyond Burger would have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nBeyond Burger accounted for approximately 52%, 51% and 50% of our gross revenues in 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively. The Beyond Burger is our flagship product and has historically been the focal point of our development and marketing efforts, and we believe that sales of the Beyond Burger will continue to constitute a significant portion of our revenues, income and cash flow for the foreseeable future. We announced the fourth generation of our core beef platform, Beyond IV, and rolled out the new Beyond Burger and Beyond Beef in 2024. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to expand production and distribution of the Beyond Burger, or that customer demand for our other existing and future products, including the Beyond IV platform, will expand to allow such products to represent a larger percentage of our revenue than they do currently. Accordingly, any factor adversely affecting sales of the Beyond Burger could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, increase the prices of our products; however, consumers may not be willing to pay increased prices for our products or, if we cannot maintain such prices in accordance with our business strategy, our margins may stagnate or decrease.\nAs part of our efforts to expand our gross margin, we have in the past, and may also in the future, increase the prices of certain or all of our products in order to offset cost increases or improve the profitability of our business. Our ability to maintain prices or effectively implement price increases may be affected by several factors, including competition—from both conventional animal-protein companies and other plant-based meat brands, the effectiveness of our marketing programs, the continuing strength of our brand, market demand for our products or in the plant-based meat category generally and general economic conditions, including broader inflationary pressures. Consumers may be less willing or able to pay a price premium for our products, during challenging economic times or at all, and may choose to purchase lower-priced or other value offerings, making it more difficult for us to maintain prices or effectively implement price increases. In addition, our retail partners and distributors may pressure us to rescind price increases we have announced or already implemented, whether through a change in list price or increased trade and promotional activity. If we cannot maintain or increase prices for our products in accordance with our business strategy, our margins may be adversely affected. Furthermore, price increases generally cause volume losses, as consumers tend to purchase fewer units at higher price points. If such losses are greater than expected, or if we lose distribution due to price increases, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nFailure to continually innovate and successfully introduce and commercialize new products or successfully improve existing products may adversely affect our ability to continue to grow.\nA key element of our long-term growth strategy depends on our ability to develop and market new products and improvements to our existing products that meet our standards for quality and appeal to consumer\npreferences. For example, in 2024, we announced our fourth generation of our core beef platform, Beyond IV and rolled out the Beyond Burger IV and Beyond Beef IV, followed by the Beyond Sausage IV generation of products, the Beyond Sun Sausage line and Beyond Bakes. In February 2025, we announced an expanded line of Beyond Steak. The success of our innovation and product development efforts, including the Beyond IV platform and the Beyond Sun Sausage and Beyond Steak lines, is affected by our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences, accurately predict taste preferences and purchasing habits of consumers in new geographic markets, the technical capability of our innovation staff in developing and testing product prototypes, including complying with applicable governmental regulations, commercialization and scale-up of new products, the success of our management and sales and marketing teams in introducing and marketing new products, and our ability to adapt to changes in technology, including the successful utilization of data analytics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. Our innovation staff members are continuously testing alternative plant-based proteins to the proteins we currently use in our products, as they seek to find additional protein options to our current ingredients that are more easily sourced, and which retain and build upon the quality and appeal of our current product offerings. Failure to develop, commercialize and market new products that appeal to consumers may lead to a decrease in our growth, sales and profitability.\nAdditionally, the development and introduction of new products, such as the Beyond IV platform and Beyond Sun Sausage and Beyond Steak lines, requires substantial research, development and marketing expenditures, which we may be unable to recoup if the new products do not gain widespread market acceptance. If we are unsuccessful in meeting our objectives with respect to new or improved products, our business could be harmed.\nIngredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly, which may negatively impact the profitability of our business.\nWe purchase large quantities of raw materials, including ingredients derived from European and North American yellow peas, sunflower seeds, rice, faba beans, avocado oil, canola oil and coconut oil. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of cardboard, film and plastic to package our products. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including increased tariffs, global competition for resources, weather conditions, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. Volatility in the prices of raw materials and other supplies we purchase could increase our cost of sales and reduce our profitability. Moreover, we may not be able to implement price increases for our products to cover any increased costs, and any price increases we do implement may result in lower sales volumes. If we are not successful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Brand\nWe face intense competition in our market from our competitors, including manufacturers of animal-based meat products and other brands that produce plant-based meat products, and potential competitors and new market entrants and we may lack sufficient financial or other resources to compete successfully.\nOur future success depends, in large part, on our ability to implement our long-term growth strategy of expanding supply and distribution, improving placement of our products, attracting new consumers to our brand and introducing new products and product extensions, and expanding into new geographic markets. If we fail to implement this growth strategy or if we invest resources in a growth strategy that ultimately proves unsuccessful, our sales and operating results will be adversely affected. Our ability to implement this growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to:\n•\nsuccessfully implement our cost-reduction initiatives and cost down strategy in the nearer term;\n•\nmanage relationships with various suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors, customers and other third parties, and expend time and effort to integrate new suppliers, co-manufacturers, distributors and customers into our fulfillment operations;\n•\ncontinue to compete in retail and foodservice channels;\n•\nsecure placement in the meat case for our products;\n•\nincrease our brand recognition and expand and maintain brand loyalty;\n•\ndevelop new product lines and extensions; and\n•\nexpand into new geographic markets.\nOur ability to implement our long-term growth strategy also depends on our ability to continue to compete in the retail and foodservice channels. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Numerous brands and products compete for limited retailer shelf space, foodservice customers and consumers. In our market, competition is based on, among other things, taste, price and promotion tactics, nutritional profile, ingredients, texture, ease of integration into the consumer diet, low-carbohydrate, low-sugar, high fiber and protein, lack of cholesterol and GMOs, convenience, versatility, brand awareness and loyalty among customers, media spending, product variety and packaging, access to major retailer shelf space and retail locations, access to major foodservice outlets and integration into menus, innovation and intellectual property protection.\nIn response to increased competition, as well as reduced consumer confidence, changes in consumer spending and potential recessionary and inflationary pressures, we have made changes in our pricing architecture including price increases of certain of our products in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels, and may in the future make changes, which may have a negative impact on our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin and profitability, impacting period-over-period results.\nWe compete with conventional animal-protein companies such as Cargill, Hormel, JBS, Perdue Foods and Tyson, who may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and whose animal-based products are well-accepted in the marketplace today. They may also have lower operational costs, and as a result may be able to offer conventional animal meat to customers at lower costs than plant-based meat. This could cause us to lower our prices, resulting in lower profitability or, in the alternative, cause us to lose market share if we fail to lower prices.\nWe also compete with other food brands, including brands affiliated with conventional animal-protein companies and other large food operators, that develop and sell plant-based meat products, including, but not limited to, Boca Foods (Kraft Heinz), Lightlife and Field Roast (Maple Leaf Foods), Gardein (Conagra), Hungry Planet, Inc., Impossible Foods, Incogmeato/Morningstar Farms (Kellanova), Moving Mountains, Omnipork (OmniFoods), Tofurky, Sweet Earth and Awesome Burger (Nestlé S.A.), Raised & Rooted (Tyson), Happy Little Plants (Hormel), Sysco’s Simply Plant-Based Meatless Burger, The Not Company and Vegetarian Butcher (Unilever), and with companies which may be more innovative, have more resources and be able to bring new products to market faster and to more quickly exploit and serve niche markets. This includes mycelium-based meat alternatives, such as Quorn, Meati and Nature’s Fynd, which leverage fermentation technology to create products with a texture and nutritional profile similar to animal proteins. Furthermore, a number of U.S. and international companies are working on developing lab-grown or “clean meat,” an animal-protein product cultivated from cells taken from animals, which could have a similar appeal to consumers as plant-based meat products. We compete with these competitors for foodservice customers, retailer shelf space and consumers.\nGenerally, the food industry is dominated by multinational corporations with substantially greater resources and operations than us. We cannot be certain that we will successfully compete with larger competitors that have greater financial, sales and technical resources or with new competitors and market entrants. Conventional food companies may acquire our competitors or launch their own plant-based meat products, and they may be able to use their resources and scale to respond to competitive pressures and changes in\nconsumer preferences by introducing new products, reducing prices or increasing promotional activities, among other things. Retailers also market competitive products under their own private labels, which are generally sold at lower prices and compete with some of our products. Similarly, retailers could change the merchandising of our products and we may be unable to retain the placement of our products in meat cases to effectively compete with animal-protein products. Competitive pressures, new competitors and market entrants or other factors could cause us to lose market share, which may require us to lower prices, increase marketing and advertising expenditures, or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns, each of which would adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability.\nOur brand and reputation may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe believe our consumers rely on us to provide them with high-quality plant-based meat products. Therefore, real or perceived quality or food safety concerns or failures to comply with applicable food regulations and requirements, whether or not ultimately based on fact and whether or not involving us (such as incidents involving our competitors), could cause negative publicity and reduced confidence in our company, brand or products, or the industry as a whole, which could in turn harm our reputation and sales, and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we believe we have a rigorous quality control process, there can be no assurance that our products will always comply with the standards set for our products, and although we strive to keep our products free of pathogenic organisms, they may not be easily detected and cross-contamination can occur. There is no assurance that this health risk will always be preempted by our quality control processes.\nWe have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. Accordingly, consumers may prepare our products in a manner that is inconsistent with our directions or store our products for long periods of time, which may adversely affect the quality and safety of our products. If consumers do not perceive our products to be safe or of high quality, including concerns regarding whether certain of our products are perceived as “ultra-processed” or otherwise contribute to health conditions, then the value of our brand would be diminished, and our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nAny loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the ingredients used in our products or in the safety and quality of our products would be difficult and costly to overcome. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our position in the market as a purveyor of high-quality plant-based meat products and may significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products, regardless of the cause, may have a substantial and adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results.\nThe growing use of social and digital media by us, our consumers and third parties increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared. Negative publicity about us, our brands or our products on social or digital media could seriously damage our brands and reputation. If we do not maintain the favorable perception of our brands, our sales and profits could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain our brand, our business could suffer.\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that has contributed significantly to the success of our business, and we believe our continued success depends on our ability to maintain and grow the value of the Beyond Meat brand. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand and reputation will depend on, among other factors, the success of our plant-based product offerings, food safety, quality assurance, marketing and merchandising efforts, the nutritional benefits provided by our products and our ability to provide a consistent, high-quality customer experience. Negative publicity has adversely affected our business in the past, and any widespread negative publicity, regardless of its accuracy, could in the future materially adversely affect our business, results of operation and reputation. Brand value is based on perceptions of subjective qualities, and any incident that erodes the loyalty of our customers, suppliers or co-manufacturers, including adverse publicity, negative media or a governmental investigation or litigation, could significantly reduce the value of our brand and significantly damage our business.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nOur international operations could expose us to substantial business, regulatory, political, financial and economic risks.\nOur international operations could expose us to substantial risks, such as risks associated with taxation, inflation, food labeling legislation, environmental regulations, foreign currency exchange rates, the labor market, property and financial regulations, public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and the outbreak of hostilities or war. Our ability to operate internationally may be adversely affected by changes in, or our failure to comply with, foreign laws and regulations. In addition, we are exposed to risks associated with our international workforce, including with respect to changes in employment and labor laws, which could increase our operating costs. There is also significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries, including China, Canada and Mexico, with respect to trade policies, treaties, government regulations and tariffs.\nIn February 2025, we made a number of strategic decisions, including the decision to suspend our operational activities in China and reduce our workforce in China by 95%.

        "original_content": "Cybersecurity Governance\nOur board of directors considers cybersecurity risk as part of its risk oversight function and in February 2024, delegated to the risk committee of the board of directors (“Risk Committee”) oversight of cybersecurity risks and incidents and any other risks and incidents relevant to the Company’s computerized information\nsystem controls and security. Prior to February 2024, the board of directors had delegated this oversight to the audit committee of the board of directors. The Risk Committee oversees management’s implementation of our cybersecurity risk management program.\nThe Risk Committee receives annual reports from management on our cybersecurity risks. In addition, management updates the Risk Committee, as necessary, regarding any material cybersecurity incidents, as well as any incidents with lesser impact potential.\nThe Risk Committee reports to the full board of directors regarding its activities.\nOur\nIT team, including our Director of IT\n, is responsible for assessing and managing our material risks from cybersecurity threats. The IT team has primary responsibility for our overall cybersecurity risk management program and supervises both our internal cybersecurity personnel and our retained external cybersecurity consultants.\nMembers of our IT team have over 10+ years of experience in operations technology support across multiple industries. The team holds industry standard certifications, related to System, Security and Network Administration, and are required to complete security awareness training multiple times per year.\nOur IT team supervises efforts to prevent, detect, mitigate, and remediate cybersecurity risks and incidents through various means, which may include briefings from internal security personnel; threat intelligence and other information obtained from governmental, public or private sources, including external consultants engaged by us; and alerts and reports produced by security tools deployed in the IT environment.\nItem 3\n,\nLegal Proceedings,\nand\nNote 10\n,\nCommitments and Contingencies\n, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nEven when not merited, the attention these lawsuits, investigations, examinations and other legal or regulatory proceedings require, and the defense of any lawsuits or other proceedings, may divert our management’s attention and may cause us to incur significant expenses. The results of such proceedings are inherently uncertain, and adverse judgments or settlements in some of these legal disputes may result in adverse monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, cash flows and results of operations. Any claims or litigation, even if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or to obtain adequate insurance in the future.\nFurthermore, while we maintain insurance for certain potential liabilities, such insurance does not cover all types and amounts of potential liabilities and is subject to self-insured retentions, various exclusions as well as caps on amounts recoverable. Even if we believe a claim is covered by insurance, insurers may dispute our entitlement to recovery for a variety of potential reasons, which may affect the timing and, if the insurers prevail, the amount of our recovery.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur share price has been and may continue to be highly volatile, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to many factors discussed in this “\nRisk Factors\n” section, including:\n•\ngeneral economic, market and political conditions, including the impact of inflation and higher interest rates across the economy and negative effects on consumer confidence and spending levels;\n•\na further decrease in demand, and the underlying factors negatively impacting demand, in the plant-based meat category, which may continue to impact demand for our products;\n•\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition and operating results, including fluctuations in our quarterly and annual results;\n•\nannouncements of innovations by us or our competitors;\n•\nannouncement by competitors or new market entrants of their entry into or exit from the plant-based meat market;\n•\noverall conditions in our industry and the markets in which we operate;\n•\nmarket conditions or trends in the packaged food sales industry or in the economy as a whole;\n•\naddition or loss of significant customers or other developments with respect to significant customers;\n•\nadverse developments concerning our manufacturers or suppliers;\n•\nchanges in laws or regulations applicable to our products or business;\n•\nour ability to effectively manage our cost-reduction initiatives and market expectations with respect to our cost-reduction initiatives;\n•\nspeculation regarding public customer announcements or geographic expansion;\n•\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n•\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n•\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n•\ncompetition from existing products or new products that may emerge;\n•\nissuance of new or updated research or reports about us or our industry, or positive or negative recommendations or withdrawal of research coverage by securities analysts;\n•\nour failure to meet the estimates and projections of the investment community or that we may otherwise provide to the public;\n•\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n•\ndisputes or other developments related to proprietary rights, including patents, and our ability to obtain intellectual property protection for our products;\n•\nlitigation or regulatory matters;\n•\nannouncement or expectation of additional financing efforts;\n•\nour cash position;\n•\nour indebtedness and ability to pay such indebtedness, as well as our ability to comply with covenants under our credit agreement;\n•\nsales of our common stock by our stockholders;\n•\nissuance of equity or debt;\n•\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our common stock;\n•\nchanges in accounting practices;\n•\nineffectiveness of our internal controls;\n•\nshort-selling of our common stock;\n•\nnegative media or marketing campaigns undertaken by our competitors or lobbyists supporting the meat industry;\n•\nthe public’s response to publicity relating to the health aspects or nutritional value of our products;\n•\nthe effects of COVID-19 and any other pandemic, epidemic or other public health crisis; and\n•\nother events or factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, tariffs, international currency fluctuations, or the effects of disease outbreaks or pandemics (such as COVID-19), may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. For example, we are currently subject to a securities case filed against us alleging federal securities law violations with respect to past disclosure. We are also currently subject to multiple shareholder derivative lawsuits related, in part, to the securities case. Securities litigation, and any other type of litigation, brought against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management’s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nFuture sales or issuances of our common stock in the public market could cause our share price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could occur at any time. For example, we may sell additional shares of common stock in public or private offerings, or pursuant to our ATM Program, and may also sell securities convertible into common stock. In addition, 8,234,230 shares of our common stock are reserved for potential issuance upon the conversion of the Notes.\nWe expect to raise significant additional capital through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities, and/or incur other indebtedness to continue to fund our operations and repay our indebtedness in the future. To continue bolstering and restructuring our balance sheet, subject to our compliance with applicable laws, the applicable requirements of the Equity Distribution Agreement with B. Riley, as sales agent, under the ATM Program, and market conditions, we expect to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity and/or debt securities in 2025, through the ATM Program or otherwise, which will result in additional dilution to our existing stockholders and may negatively impact the market price of our common stock. Any issuance of equity or debt securities may be for cash or in exchange for our outstanding Notes, which could have a highly dilutive effect on current stockholders and could negatively affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition to resulting in additional dilution to our existing stockholders or negatively affecting the trading price of our common stock, any such potential financings may result in the imposition of debt covenants and repayment obligations, or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. Furthermore, any such securities issued pursuant to potential financings may include rights that are senior to our shares of common stock.\nSales of our common stock, by us or otherwise, or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares of our common stock intend to sell shares, could reduce the market price of our common stock. We cannot predict the size of future sales or issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock or the effect, if any, that any such future sales or issuances will have on the market price of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our business or publish unfavorable research about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our share price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if any of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of the investor community, our share price could decline.\nWe have never paid dividends on our capital stock and we do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Consequently, any gains from an investment in our common stock will likely depend on whether the price of our common stock increases.\nWe have never declared or paid any dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the operation of our business and for general corporate purposes. Accordingly, investors should rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n•\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n•\nauthorizing our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could discourage a takeover attempt or delay changes in control;\n•\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n•\nproviding that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n•\nprohibiting the adoption, amendment or repeal of our amended and restated bylaws or the repeal of the provisions of our restated certificate of incorporation regarding the election and removal of directors without the required approval of at least 66.67% of the shares entitled to vote at an election of directors;\n•\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n•\nlimiting the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n•\nrequiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals, including without limitation, compliance with the requirements of Rule 14a-19 under the Exchange Act, as applicable.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporate Law, or the DGCL, govern us. These provisions may prohibit large stockholders, in particular those owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock, from merging or combining with us for a certain period of time without the consent of our board of directors.\nThese and other provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forums for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or employees.\nOur restated certificate of incorporation provides that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is the exclusive forum for:\n•\nany derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n•\nany action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by, or other wrongdoing by, any of our directors, officers, employees or agents to us or our stockholders;\n•\nany action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, our restated certificate of incorporation, or our amended and restated bylaws;\n•\nany action to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws; and\n•\nany action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine;\nwith our amended and restated bylaws providing that stockholders will have been deemed to consent to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts in the State of Delaware for such actions. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation provides that with respect to any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf to enforce any liability or duty created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder, the exclusive forum will be the federal district courts of the United States of America. Our restated certificate of incorporation further provides that the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act.\nThese exclusive forum provisions may limit a stockholder’s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees.\nOur ability to utilize our federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be limited under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).\nAs of December 31, 2024, the Company has accumulated federal, state and foreign net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $1.2 billion, $477.5 million and $107.1 million, respectively. Approximately $1.1 billion of the federal net operating losses and $76.1 million of the state net operating losses do not expire and the remaining federal, state and foreign tax loss carryforwards begin to expire in 2031, 2031 and 2025 respectively, unless previously utilized. Utilization of the Company’s net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the Code and similar state provisions.\nThe limitations apply if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change,” which is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period. We have experienced several ownership changes none of which is expected to result in a material limitation on the future use of our net operating loss and credit carryforwards generated prior to these ownership changes. However, any future changes in our stock ownership, which may be outside of our control, may trigger an ownership change and, consequently, Section 382 and 383 limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future income tax liability to us. We are currently analyzing whether and to what extent we have experienced an ownership change pursuant to Section 382; and to the extent such change occurred, the impact to the availability of our tax attributes.",

        "original_content": "Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nincluded elsewhere in this report. The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nOur Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations included in this document generally discusses 2024 and 2023 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2024 and 2023. Discussions of 2022 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2023 and 2022 that are not included in this document can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023.\nOverview\nBeyond Meat is a leading plant-based meat company, offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meats. We build meat directly from plants, an innovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other sensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying the nutritional and environmental benefits of eating our plant-based meat products. Our brand promise, “Eat What You Love,” represents a strong belief that there is a better way to feed our future and that the positive choices we all make, no matter how small, can have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet. By shifting from animal-based meat to plant-based meat, we can positively impact four growing global issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources and animal welfare.\nWe sell a range of plant-based meat products across our three core platforms of beef, pork and poultry. As of December 2024, Beyond Meat branded products were available at approximately 129,000 retail and foodservice outlets in more than 65 countries worldwide, across mainstream grocery, mass merchandiser, club store and natural retailer channels, and various food-away-from-home channels, including restaurants, foodservice outlets and schools. The number of retail and foodservice outlets where Beyond Meat branded products are available was derived from rolling 52-week data as of December 2024 and excludes outlets unique to Beyond Meat Jerky, which we discontinued in 2024 as part of our Global Operations Review.\nNet revenues decreased to $326.5 million in 2024 from $343.4 million in 2023, representing a 4.9% decrease. We have generated losses since inception. Net loss in 2024 and 2023 was $160.3 million and $338.1 million, respectively, as weak demand, driven by prolonged softness in demand in the category and for our products in certain channels and regions and increased competition, among other things, resulted in declines in our net revenues that we were unable to offset with commensurate cost reductions. Our operating environment continues to be affected by uncertainty related to macroeconomic issues, including ongoing, further weakened demand in the plant-based meat category, inflation, higher interest rates, current and proposed future tariffs, and potential recessionary concerns, among other things, all of which have had and could continue to have unforeseen impacts on our actual realized results. In recent periods, our net revenues, gross profit, gross margin, earnings and cash flows have been adversely impacted by the following, each of which may continue to impact our business and financial condition in the future:\n•\nunfavorable changes in our product sales mix, including the launch of new products, which may carry lower margin profiles relative to existing products, increased sales generally carrying a lower selling price per pound as a percentage of our total sales to strategic QSR customers, and lower demand for our core products;\n•\ncontinued weak demand and its resultant impact on our sales due to slower category growth, particularly for refrigerated plant-based meat;\n•\nunfavorable changes in consumers’ perceptions about the health attributes of plant-based meats and increased competitive activity;\n•\ndeceleration of the adoption of plant-based meat across Europe and our ability to successfully launch extended shelf-life products, which could negatively impact our ability to expand distribution of our products;\n•\nthe impact of high inflation and the plant-based meat sector’s premium pricing relative to animal protein, which have caused and could continue to cause consumers to avoid plant-based meat or trade down into cheaper forms of protein, including animal meat, beans and other non-animal meat protein sources;\n•\nnegative impacts on capacity utilization as a result of lower than anticipated demand and, therefore, production volumes, which have in the past and could in the future give rise to increased costs per unit, underutilization fees, termination fees and other costs to exit certain supply chain arrangements and product lines, and/or the write-down or write-off of certain equipment and other fixed assets and impairment charges, driving less leverage on fixed costs and delaying the speed at which cost savings initiatives positively impact our financial results;\n•\nchanges in forecasted demand, including for our core products—namely Beyond Burger, Beyond Beef, Beyond Chicken, Beyond Steak and Beyond Sausage—and others;\n•\nmanaging inventory levels, including sales to liquidation channels at lower prices, write-down or write-off of obsolete inventory, or increase in inventory provision;\n•\nchanges in our pricing strategy, including actions intended to improve our price competitiveness relative to competing products or to improve profitability, such as price increases of certain of our products in our U.S. retail and foodservice channels that we implemented in 2024;\n•\nincreased unit cost of goods sold due to input cost inflation, including higher transportation, storage, raw materials, energy, labor and supply chain costs;\n•\npotential disruption to our supply chain generally caused by distribution and other logistical issues, including the impact of cyber incidents at suppliers and vendors; and\n•\nlabor needs at the Company as well as in the supply chain and at customers.\nCost-Reduction Initiatives and Global Operations Review\nIn response to the difficult environment and the negative impact of certain factors on our business and the overall plant-based meat category, beginning in 2022 we pivoted our focus toward sustainable long-term growth supported by three pillars: (1) driving margin recovery and operating expense reduction through the implementation of lean value streams across our beef, pork and poultry platforms; (2) inventory reduction and cash flow generation through more efficient inventory management; and (3) focusing on near-term retail and foodservice growth drivers while supporting key strategic long-term partners and opportunities.\nTo reduce operating expenses, in November 2023, we initiated our Global Operations Review, which involves narrowing our commercial focus to certain anticipated growth opportunities, and accelerating activities that prioritize gross margin expansion and cash generation. These efforts have to date included, and may in the future include, the exit or discontinuation of select product lines such as Beyond Meat Jerky; changes to our pricing architecture within certain channels; cash-accretive inventory reduction initiatives; non-cash charges such as provision for excess and obsolete inventory and potential additional impairment charges, write-offs and disposals of fixed assets, and losses on sale and write-down of fixed assets; further optimization of our manufacturing capacity and real estate footprint; planned and future reductions in our workforce; and the planned suspension of our operational activities in China.\nAs part of this review, on November 1, 2023, our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce by approximately 65 employees, representing approximately 19% of our global non-production workforce (or approximately 8% of our total global workforce).\nThe following table summarizes the non-cash charges recorded in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2023 as part of our Global Operations Review:\n_________\n(1) Includes $16.5 million associated with Beyond Meat Jerky. As part of our Global Operations Review, in 2023, we made the decision to discontinue the Beyond Meat Jerky product line and discontinued it in 2024.\n(2) Includes $3.6 million associated with Beyond Meat Jerky fixed assets.\nOn February 24, 2025, our board of directors approved a plan to reduce our workforce in North America and the EU by approximately 44 employees, representing approximately 17% of our global non-production workforce (or approximately 6% of our total global workforce) (the “2025 RIF”). The decision was based on cost-reduction initiatives intended to reduce operating expenses.\nIn addition, as part of our Global Operations Review, on February 24, 2025, our board of directors approved a plan to suspend our current operational activities in China, which are estimated to cease by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As part of this plan, we are reducing our workforce in China by approximately 20 employees, representing approximately 95% of our China workforce (or approximately 3% of our total global workforce) (the “China RIF”). The decision was based on cost-reduction initiatives intended to reduce operating expenses.\nSee\nNote 15\n,\nSubsequent Events,\nto the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe may not be able to fully realize the cost savings and benefits initially anticipated from our cost-reduction initiatives and Global Operations Review, and the realized costs may be greater than expected.

Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.

The Company builds meat directly from plants, an innovation that enables consumers to experience the taste, texture and other sensory attributes of popular animal-based meat products while enjoying the nutritional and environmental benefits of eating the Company’s plant-based meat products. The Company’s brand promise, “Eat What You Love,” represents a strong belief that there is a better way to feed our future and that the positive choices we all make, no matter how small, can have a great impact on our personal health and the health of our planet. By shifting from animal-based meat to plant-based meat, we can positively impact\nfour\ngrowing global issues: human health, climate change, constraints on natural resources and animal welfare.\nThe Company has the following subsidiaries:\n•\nBeyond Meat EU B.V., in the Netherlands\n•\nBeyond Meat (Jiaxing) Food Co., Ltd. (“BYND JX”), in the Zhejiang Province in China\n•\nBeyond Meat Canada Inc., in Canada.\nOn January 25, 2021, the Company entered into the Planet Partnership, LLC, a joint venture with PepsiCo, Inc., to develop, produce and market innovative snack and beverage products made from plant-based protein.\nThe Company’s primary production facilities are located in Columbia, Missouri, and Devault, Pennsylvania, and its research and development and administrative offices are located in El Segundo, California. The Company owns a manufacturing facility in Enschede, the Netherlands, where it produces its woven protein and dry blend flavor systems for shipment to local co-manufacturers, including one of the Company’s distributors who built a co-manufacturing facility in the Netherlands used for production of the Company’s finished goods.\nIn Jiaxing, China, the Company leases a manufacturing facility, and leases a facility in Shanghai, China, which is used as a local research and development facility. In addition to its own production facilities, the Company uses co-manufacturers in various locations in the United States, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands and China.\nIn 2021, the Company entered into a lease agreement to house its corporate headquarters, lab and innovation space in El Segundo, California. In 2022, upon completion of the Phase 1-A of the new campus facility in El Segundo, the Company moved its Innovation team from the Manhattan Beach Project Innovation Center to the new campus facility. In June 2023, upon completion of the tenant improvements associated with Phase 1-B, the Company moved its headquarters, sales and marketing operations into the newly constructed Campus Headquarters. In June 2023, the Company terminated the lease of its former headquarters, also in El Segundo, California.\nThe Company sells to a variety of customers in the retail and foodservice channels throughout the United States and internationally primarily through distributors who purchase, store, sell, and deliver the Company’s products. In addition, the Company sells directly to customers in the retail and foodservice channels who handle their own distribution.\nBEYOND MEAT, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nGlobal Operations Review\nIn 2023, to reduce operating expenses, the Company initiated a review of its global operations (the “Global Operations Review”), narrowing the Company’s commercial focus to certain anticipated growth opportunities, and accelerating activities that prioritize gross margin expansion and cash generation. As part of this review, on November 1, 2023, the Company’s board of directors approved a plan to reduce the Company’s workforce by approximately\nemployees, representing approximately\n% of the Company’s global non-production workforce (or approximately\n% of our total global workforce).\nOn February 24, 2025, the company’s board of directors approved a plan to reduce the Company’s workforce in North America and the EU by approximately\nemployees, representing approximately\n% of the Company’s global non-production workforce (or approximately\n% of the Company’s total global workforce). In addition, as part of the Company’s Global Operations Review, on February 24, 2025, the Company’s board of directors approved a plan to suspend the Company’s current operational activities in China, which are estimated to cease by the end of the second quarter of 2025. As part of this plan, the Company is reducing its workforce in China by approximately\nemployees, representing approximately\n% of the Company’s China workforce (or approximately\n% of the Company’s total global workforce). See\nNote 15.\nNote 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nFiscal Year\nThe Company operates on a fiscal calendar year, and each interim quarter is comprised of one 5-week period and two 4-week periods, with each week ending on a Saturday. The Company’s fiscal year always begins on January 1 and ends on December 31. As a result, the Company’s first and fourth fiscal quarters may have more or fewer days included than a traditional 91-day fiscal quarter.\nSegment Information\nThe Company has\none\noperating segment and\none\nreportable segment, in the plant-based meat industry, offering a portfolio of revolutionary plant-based meat. The Company’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), who is its Chief Executive Officer and President, reviews operating results to make decisions about allocating resources and assessing performance for the entire company. The Company derives revenue primarily in North America and Europe and manages the business activities on a consolidated basis. The Company’s CODM allocates resources and assesses performance at the consolidated level.\nSee\nNote 14",

Based on that evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer have concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act). Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nBased on our evaluation under the framework set forth in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013), our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2024.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2024 has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in its report which is included below.\nAttestation Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe attestation report of the independent registered public accounting firm, Deloitte & Touche LLP, on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is included below under the heading “Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm.”\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2024 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nOur management does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Further, the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within our Company have been detected.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Beyond Meat, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Beyond Meat, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2024, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).

Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nLos Angeles, California\nMarch 5, 2025",
